This is murder! Broad daylight murder! No matter what she may have said or not said. In fact even if she said it! They killed that girl for nothing. A zoo has some sense of order self… Nigeria is not a place! https://t.co/2Gyabavjys",272,113,https://twitter.com/dj_switchaholic/status/1524759918481391617,2022-05-12 14:34:27+00:00

AishaYesufu,Aisha Yesufu,"You have no busines telling people how to express their pains. Respect Nigeria all you want. It is you. Let others do them.
In the meantime, remember that a young Nigerian just like you is currently in the morgue because Nigeria was worse than a zoo. The next victim can be ME! https://t.co/QsC38zLYPr",72,22,https://twitter.com/AishaYesufu/status/1351104985052962820,2021-01-18 09:51:45+00:00
AishaYesufu,Aisha Yesufu,"Many of those whose accounts were blocked are in their early 20s. Nigeria shamelessly blocked their accounts because they demanded that @PoliceNG should stop profiling &amp; killing them and you are more concerned that they called Nigeria a zoo?
Have you put yourself in their shoes?",1505,547,https://twitter.com/AishaYesufu/status/1351101927338205185,2021-01-18 09:39:36+00:00
AishaYesufu,Aisha Yesufu,Calling Nigeria a zoo is actually a compliment. It is worse. Killings don't happen in zoos indiscriminately. It is more like a jungle but then killings in jungles is for a purpose. Nigeria is in a category of itself where killings happen indiscriminately with no purpose. https://t.co/of6q8CrL0e,1905,1002,https://twitter.com/AishaYesufu/status/1351094910653526019,2021-01-18 09:11:43+00:00
