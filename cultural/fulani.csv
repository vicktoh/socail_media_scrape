bulamabukarti,Bulama Bukarti,I agree with you on this. Some even falsely say that it‚Äôs a Fulani Jihad.

bulamabukarti,Bulama Bukarti,You could say 90+% of JAS is Kanuri. Most members of Ansaru are Hausa/Fulani. Their first leader was Muhammad Auwal from Gombe. Some BH scholars even hypothesize that it‚Äôs partly because of tribal politics that Ansaru broke away from BH.
