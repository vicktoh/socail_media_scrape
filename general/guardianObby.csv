"Soludo inaugurates transition committee, restates vision for Anambra",https://guardian.ng/news/soludo-inaugurates-transition-committee-restates-vision-for-anambra/,"Anambra State Governor-elect, Prof. Charles Chukwuma Soludo, has restated his vision and manifesto for the state, saying that his campaign promises are not mere political statements, but social contract with Anambra people. Soludo restated this, yesterday, at the inauguration of 2022 Transition and Handover Committee in Agulu, Anaocha Council. The committee, headed by former World Bank Executive and ex-Minister of Education, Dr. Oby Ezekwesili, has 80 members from within and outside the state. The Governor-elect said he was committed to the transformation of the state, stressing that he will ensure impactful leadership and realisation his campaign promises. He said the task before him was huge and that his vision for a better and industrialised Anambra State was achievable and as such, all hands must be on deck to actualise his vision for the state. “Having a peaceful, progressive and prosperous Anambra State is the collective dream and responsibility of every one in Anambra. There is the need for everyone to own the growth and development of Anambra by contributing through selfless service.” “Anambra must be transformed to a mega industrialised economy. The challenges of our roads in the rural areas and cities, markets, environment must be addressed,” he said. While accepting the responsibility, Ezekwesili thanked Soludo for the honour and charged members to be committed to the task of building a great future for the state. She highlighted ground rules, agenda and terms of reference of the committee, stressing that their mission was to boost the effectiveness of the governor-elect and the incoming government in the quest to build a livable and prosperous smart megacity. Ezekwesili charged members of the committee to be committed and dedicated to building a great future for Anambra people.

Soludo applauded for choice of transition committee members,https://guardian.ng/news/soludo-applauded-for-choice-of-transition-committee-members/,"The Anambra Civil Society Network (ACSONET) has commended Anambra Governor-elect, Prof. Charles Soludo, over his choice of members of the transition committee. Specifically, the group commended Soludo for appointing Mrs. Oby Ezekwesili as chairman of the committee and inclusion of professors Chidi Odinkalu and Pat Utomi, among 77 other technocrats, who have distinguished themselves in their chosen careers. In a statement issued by its Chairman, Prince Chris Azor, yesterday, it expressed the hope that they would deliver to ensure smooth swearing in of Soludo, who takes over the affairs of Anambra State from Willie Obiano on March 17, 2022. It described Soludo’s move as: “Spot-on and a sign of good things to come from the erudite scholar and former Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN).” Azor, who is also the Civil Society Co-Chair, Open Government Partnership (OGP), said the appointment reflected: “Inclusion, non-partsanship, competence, integrity and liberalism.” While commending Obiano for giving Soludo necessary cooperation so far, he expressed optimism that the inauguration of the committee members and the first plenary sessions scheduled for between January 19 and 22, 2022, would be guided by their terms of reference."
"Ezekwesili, Awosika, others to speak at Inspiring Woman Series 10",https://guardian.ng/saturday-magazine/ezekwesili-awosika-others-to-speak-at-inspiring-woman-series-10/,"All roads lead to the Civic Centre, in Lagos, next Friday as the 10th annual edition of the Inspiring Women series is set to hold, with some of the country’s most prolific industry leaders. With this year’s edition tagged Because She Dared, the annual women’s conference which is a gathering of women for the purpose of knowledge sharing, enlightenment and networking provides a platform for a lot of accomplished women in different spheres of life to tell their unique stories, in order to inspire young women. The conference will host speakers which include: the Founder/CEO of The Chair Centre Group Ibukun Awosika as chairperson, and Senior Economic Adviser of the Africa Economic Development Policy Initiative, Oby Ezekwesili, as a keynote speaker. Other speakers includes: Boma Alabi (SAN) Chairman, Just Commercial Vehicles Nigeria Limited, Fatima Wali-Abdurrahman, Senior Advisor to the Group President, Dangote Industries Limited, Cecilia Akintomide, Former Vice President Secretary General AFDB, Hansatu Adegbite Executive Director, WIMBIZ, among others. The event’s convener, Kemi Ajumobi commented that, “I am somebody who is intrigued by people’s stories, I do not believe that people just wake up and become great suddenly; I love to trace how they began. So, every time I spoke with women and they shared that part of their lives, I discovered that every woman who has made it to the top has a unique success story of struggles to break the glass ceiling.”

Ezekwesili offers solution to Africa’s education challenges,https://guardian.ng/news/ezekwesili-offers-solution-to-africas-education-challenges/,"Former Minister of Education, Dr. Oby Ezekwesili, has said the call in many quarters for increased funding of education in Nigeria and other African countries would not solve challenges bedevilling the sector.  She stated this at the launch of Human Capital Africa (HCA), an accountability and advocacy initiative spearheaded by her, yesterday in Abuja.  The organisation was launched on the sidelines of the 27th Nigerian Economic Summit (NES27), themed “Securing Our Future: The Fierce Urgency of Now.”	 Noting that the region’s education sector was suffering from a structural deficit, the
ex-Vice President for the World Bank’s Africa Region observed that investing in foundational literacy and numeracy would form the basis of the continent’s development strategy.

Ezekwesili canvasses solid education system to develop Nigeria,https://guardian.ng/news/ezekwesili-canvasses-solid-education-system-to-develop-nigeria/,"Former Minister of Education, Dr. Oby Ezekwesili, has stressed the need for a robust education system that teaches character and leadership and others to kick-start Nigeria’s development journey. She gave the charge at the graduation of the third Cohort of Teach For Nigeria (TFN) fellows in Lagos over the weekend.	 Ezekwesili acknowledged that the body was addressing issue of quality teachers as bedrock of any nation. She said the non-governmental organisation had picked the best graduates across the federation, giving them the opportunity to explore and change the state of education in the country. The activist stated that the most populous black nation needed to reform its education sector and work with like-minded organisations to transform rural communities with experienced teachers to impact the grassroots. The ex-minister charged the graduates to be focused in transforming Nigeria through the knowledge they have acquired.	 In his remarks, TFN’s Chairman, Gbenga Oyebode, urged the fellows’ continued commitment to the fellowship, assuring that the board remains committed to the sustainability of the programme. The Chief Executive Officer, Folawe Omikunle, said the graduating class of 2021 had shown resilience and strong leadership, even in the face of a global pandemic.	 “When COVID-19 completely disrupted our nation’s education system, they navigated the digital divide to ensure teaching and learning continued.  “This cohort of fellows, who taught in 29 schools across Ogun State, experienced unprecedented struggle, joy, perseverance and love,” she added."
"Ezekwesili, others list obstacles to Nigeria’s development’",https://guardian.ng/news/ezekwesili-others-list-obstacles-to-nigerias-development/,"Human rights activist and Chairman, Fix Politics, Oby Ezekwesili, has said that absence of good governance is the greatest obstacle to Nigeria’s economic development. According to her, “the failure of the country’s variant of politics and public leadership inherently subverts public good and places their personal and narrow interest above the collective wellbeing of citizens.”  To her, nothing about Nigeria can change without a transformation of its politics. The former Education Minister suggested that, to achieve good governance, there should be established unconventional school of politics, policy and governance to flood the political space with a new class of value-based politicians, mobilise the Nigerian public to collectively demand for a new constitutional, political, electoral and economic restructuring of Nigeria and raising the influence of the electorate. Ezekwesili spoke at the virtual inaugural dialogue of Fix Politics, themed “1999 Constitution: To Change or Amend?” Founding Chairman, Network for Justice, Usman Bugaje, who said the National Assembly had capacity to change the constitution because they are the lawmakers, however, noted that “constitutions are products of their processes.” “It is the process that confers legitimacy on the constitution. At the moment, the National assembly, though elected, does not have the legitimacy. It is the same with the executive arm of government because when you become so far away from the people, you loose trust and it is the trust that links citizens. It is the process of the constitution making and not the product that confers legitimacy.” Executive Director, Fix Politics, Anthony Ubani, described the Nigerian Constitution as the foundational principle upon which democratic nations build a good society that is anchored on the rule of law, justice, fairness and inclusiveness.  “It means therefore, that when a nation has a flawed constitution, every norm in that society will be in danger of also being flawed. It follows logically, therefore, that any meaningful effort to build a new society must necessarily begin with an honest process in which the citizens and the political class of that society come together to make for themselves a new constitution that will govern their actions and direct their path going forward,” he said."
"Ezekwesili: Unless we fix politics urgently, it will disintegrate and destroy Nigeria",https://guardian.ng/politics/ezekwesili-unless-we-fix-politics-urgently-it-will-disintegrate-and-destroy-nigeria/,"Dr. Oby Ezekwesili, a former presidential candidate in the 2019 election, served previously as Minister of Education and in the Debt Management Office (DMO). In this interview with LEO SOBECHI, she shared her insights to the shortcomings of Nigeria’s democracy and how to re-engineer politics to make governance work for the people. What would you identify as the major setbacks to genuine enthronement of democratic culture?
I recently completed research on this issue as a Richard von Weizacker Fellowship at the Robert Bosch Academy in Berlin. As a candidate for the office of the President of Nigeria in the 2019 elections, I directly witnessed the absurdity of our politics and it naturally awakened my intellectual curiosity. What I observed in politics in that short time set me off on a journey to reflect and better understand the challenges of our Democracy, Politics, and Governance. My research #FixPolitics has some interesting findings that specifically address your question. There are three interconnected factors that hinder democratic development in Nigeria and the rest of our continent. These are, the absence of a productive and politically literate, empowered and engaged voting population, the dominant culture of a political class, that is politicians and their allies across society; that subordinates the collective good of the society to their personal interest without any consequences and the existence of weak constitutional, political and electoral institutions and context, which lead to an ineffective regulatory context for politics. What essential features should define the ambitious project of fixing politics in Africa, particularly in Nigeria?
My #FixPolitics research findings concluded that every democracy, including that of Nigeria, can function well when it stands on three triangulated pillars of empowered and engaged citizens, who vote rationally for candidates that can effectively run the government on their behalf, ethical, competent, and capable politicians, who compete for votes by presenting citizens with alternative plans of how they will govern on their behalf and credible institutions that include constitutional, political and electoral bodies to regulate the relationship between citizens and politicians. This means there are three key factors that determine the quality of political culture and outcomes in democracy; the engagement of the citizens as informed and active electorate; the quality of the political class and politicians who vie for elective offices; and the institutional integrity of the political regulatory system and context. The #FixPolitics research evaluated how well these three triangulated pillars are doing in Nigeria and Africa more broadly. We have five major findings, including Adopting a theoretical model that assumes governance as a product or service in a market structure, we simplified and were able to interrogate what happens between the demand side, that is, the electorate or voters; the supply side, that is, the political class, who run for elective offices and, the institutional and regulatory context, that is, constitutional, political and electoral environment) in which both sides interact. Our politics is structurally challenged with unequal power relations between the people and a political class that is unaccountable in the exercise of their public mandate. We named the phenomenon, “monopolistic democracy” and like all monopolies, society is endangered by the distortionary effect it has on social outcomes. If we do not #FixPolitics urgently, politics will disintegrate and destroy Nigeria permanently and that is because our ruling class has entrenched a corrupted political culture that stunts the common good of citizens and their society without any consequences. The corrupted political culture undermines citizens, families, communities, society at large, businesses, and the economy as well as government, public institutions, and the governance processes. The corrupted political culture is invasive and pervasive and thus constitutes a major obstacle to the economic growth and development of Nigeria and the continent. This inhibitive effect on development is the reason for the high incidence of extreme poverty in Nigeria despite the huge endowment of population and natural resources. The good thing is that the solutions to these problems were also identified by the research. Where should the effort to fix politics begin and what could be a probable timeframe to evaluate progress?
The research found that any effort to #FixPolitics has to begin with the citizen’s pillar of the democracy triangle. It is only the Citizens Pillar that retains the credibility to fix the broken political system and corrupt culture that is to be fixed. The Political Class Pillar cannot #FixPolitics, because they are the primary beneficiaries of the anomaly in our politics, therefore, inherently lack the incentive to correct it. The Regulatory Pillar unfortunately lacks the independence, strength, capability, and credibility to check the excesses of the political class in particular. What makes the research unique is how it uses evidence to sequentially guide citizens that are persuaded to act. Fundamentally, the Citizens, who step out to #FixPolitics must act on all three pillars concurrently and simultaneously. The solutions highlighted that each Pillar must be systemically launched at the same time as the others. Citizens have to execute the political structural transformation agenda in a systematic, coherent, coordinated, and collaborative way. It is the only way citizens’ effort will gather the systemic momentum and create political structural shifts that correct political culture and outcomes. A silo approach at addressing the problems identified for each of the triangulated pillars will fail for a lack of integrative impact. It is why the Work-Study Group (WSG) is made up of a diverse group of Nigerians from all regions of Nigeria, works of life and political persuasion. The members of the WSG are bound in the common vision, mission, and core values of transforming Nigeria’s deformed politics and governance by rallying behind the #FixPolitics research findings. The WSG members work together to design and execute the programmes under each of the three pillars while collaborating on crosscutting issues in an ecosystem-building approach. On evaluating progress of #FixPolitics, it is important to clearly convey that this initiative is not a dash, but a marathon. This initiative is not about 2023. #FixPolitics is about designing Nigeria’s and Africa’s way out of the trap of underdevelopment occasioned by our faulty political foundation; it is not partisan. It is about building a new political culture of taking responsibility through participation and empowered engagement by citizens and providing service and public accountability by public leaders. More specifically, the work-plans developed for each pillar have specific and easy-to-measure actions that are of short, medium, and long-term delivery and impact. For example, in the emerging new and value-based Political Class Pillar, we are establishing an unconventional School of Politics, Policy, and Governance, which will fully commence in 2021 and annually produce at scale, a new class of value-based politicians on a mixed curriculum of theory and practice of ethical politics, design of sound economic, social, sectoral and structural policies and building strong, open, accessible, transparent and accountable institutions, regulatory and legal contexts. We are aiming to graduate 500 such people twice each year. Our school is unconventional because it is designed to disrupt the mindset of the 500 citizens that will have the privilege of being admitted into each class cohort every six months. Since the current marketplace of supply of politicians is holding the country hostage to a destructive political culture, we can upend their dominance by producing a new political class of public leaders with the requisite character, competence, and capacity. A complex mix of challenges, including low literacy level and economic deprivation has thrown up what could be described as a crisis of democracy in Nigeria, is it possible to inject sanity into the country’s politics?
You are spot-on in identifying the adverse impact of low literacy levels and poverty on our democracy. In my research, there is a conclusion that these two factors inhibit the quality of voting decisions of our electorate that are within the low-income class. First, the illiterate are likely to be poor. The daily financial worth of the productivity of poor people in our country is extremely low and so, whatever is offered them by unscrupulous politicians on Election Day is hugely attractive. For them, Election Day is simply another day of struggles to eke out a living. Election Day is not a decision about the next four years for most poor voters. They have concluded that since governance did not improve their wellbeing in the previous years, nothing in the future would change. They, therefore, rationally make a decision to sell their vote and ‘earn an income’ for each time they do so. In my conclusions, I wrote it this way: “The Price of the Vote of the low-income voters in Nigeria is extremely low, and corrupted politicians can easily pay for it.” Second, the poor who are illiterate will also likely lack political literacy and so do not realize the power of their constitutional right to vote. In the power relations between the electorate and those they vote into office, the former have failed to take their primacy in our democracy. What the #FixPolitics research recommends to these two issues are one, design a bundled and simultaneous program of economic empowerment and political literacy for low-income voters. The economic empowerment component of the programme raises their productivity. The political literacy component raises their political consciousness and awareness of their self-interest in elections and governance that follows afterward. Two, organisations and groups interested in emerging an empowered and engaged electorate then work together to use technology to identify, connect, combine and scale up existing and new programmes of economic empowerment for women and young people, who together make up more than 70 per cent of the voting population. Remember, women and young people are also the voting constituencies that actually turn up to vote on Election Day. Imagine that in-between our electoral cycles, that’s four years between one election and another, some organisations and groups collaborate to design a new economic empowerment initiative that is bundled with political literacy sessions or that they redesign existing programs in an intentional way to raise the productivity and political knowledge of say, Akara sellers across Nigeria. Imagine also that currently, Akara sellers toil for just a daily net income of say, N1000- N2000. Imagine that the programmes succeed, such that their average daily financial output doubles or triples, rising above the ‘price that politicians will offer for their vote in elections’. Now, imagine that four years later, the now more productive, empowered, and more politically conscious Akara seller is faced with the offer to sell their vote. What do you think will happen in their decision-making? It is more probable that they would resist the offer and rather vote for candidates that will govern to improve their wellbeing because they have experienced improvement from a thoughtful and effective intervention. Now they know why choosing the right candidates in elections can further improve their households and communities. Thirdly, design and launch an innovative data-based nationwide political literacy campaign using community organising modules to awaken and engage the over 60 per cent of low-income registered voter-population that has never participated in elections by voting after being registered to vote. That only 15 million out of 84 million registered voters elected a President into office in 2019 is a risk that can be transformed into an opportunity to bring in new voters without the distorted incentives of repeat voters to sell their votes. Considering our constitution, do you think Nigerians can repose confidence in the country’s political system and participate effectively?
The faulty foundation of our constitution is way deeper than even those issues you raised in that it was never the product of a citizens’ process. The military and some civilians collaborated to write a constitution, which they handed to our fourth republic democracy at the transition of 1999. The tone of the constitution is militaristic and the content, unitary for a country that parades itself as a federation. It is not “The People’s Constitution” that it portends to be. The 1999 constitution does not reflect any form of negotiated common identity, values, vision, aspirations, political and governance structures of a country with a complex spectrum of ethnic, language, regional, cultural, religious, and other diversities like Nigeria. Nigerians have never had the privilege of determining their choices of what kind of union they wish to have as we enter deeper into the 21st Century. One of the findings of the #FixPolitics research is that a credible citizen-led constitutional process and the consensus provisions the people agree to are key to helping transform, even countries with multi-ethnic nationalities intonations. There is a big difference between a country and a nation. Sadly, because of many factors that end up in elite failure, Nigeria remains a mere country and not a nation, sixty years after our independence in 1960. Worse is that even now, there are credible threats to its existence as a country. The tragic failure of our political class to successfully mobilise our citizens behind a commonly agreed identity, while at the same time respecting our multifarious uniqueness, happened at least twice in our history. The Nigerian people could have, at the end of colonial rule in 1960 and after the Civil War ended in 1970, confronted their fractured and factional union in open and honest dialogues designed to agree on key rules and terms of remaining one people. As a result of those failures to build consensus, Nigeria has hobbled along as a country of people who are not unified around common aspirations and shared principles. How different the outcomes would be if we were a country guided by aspirations like equal opportunity, inclusive growth and prosperity, social cohesion, and stability. These are proven from our #FixPolitics research as some of the building blocks on which other countries transformed their societies. We found countries like Botswana, Singapore, and South Korea to have prioritised human development, merit, productivity, and healthy competition among constituent parts as well as their citizens. The results show up in their economic performance and the vastly improved wellbeing of their citizens in contrast to Nigeria all three countries gained independence in the 1960s from Britain. However, the reality is setting in now. For after many decades of ignoring the obvious, it is becoming clearer to all discerning and reasonable compatriots that our union is facing the severest threat to its existence now. All is simply not well with Nigeria and Nigerians. Our country, Nigeria is on the brink of a break-up, despite the delusional protestations of federal government officials and their sycophants. Our ethnic and religious divides and differences have never been sharper and deeper than now. That President Buhari, who was elected by a representative section of the Nigerian people in a protest vote against his failed predecessor, has in turn dug Nigeria deeper into the trenches of humongous failure will remain a wonder of historical proportion. Nigeria’s failures under President Buhari have become profoundly unsustainable. It is perplexing to watch our political leaders carrying on with their pretense that Nigeria is currently being governed. How can the political leadership of a country, which is practically insolvent, terribly brittle on all fronts of national security and lost its diplomatic leadership and influence even in West Africa, keep acting as if everything is normal? Such imperviousness was the same attitude exhibited by the previous government of the current opposition party. Most Nigerians are fed up with the Siamese Twins-type syndrome of our politicians, regardless of whether they belong to the All Peoples Congress (APC) or the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Their party acronyms may differ, but the people in our politics today are of one embryo and exhibit a common and dominant political culture that places the narrow interests of our politicians over and above the wellbeing of the people they govern. Nigerians have experienced and now openly express frustration at the “hand-down” and “turn-by-turn failure” of the political leadership class in Nigeria at federal, state, or local government levels. They are designed by the environment that enables them to act without consequences and the incentive they respond to, to govern in ways that do not produce results for citizens. The finding from #FixPolitics research on countries, which similarly came to the precipice because of ethnic and other tensions in the last few decades is that the citizens are the block with the credibility and legitimacy to push society toward fruitful dialogues and agreements, which become translated to a new constitution. Conduct of a citizens-referendum is an innovation that was used in some countries to commence the national dialogue process with the first phase of deciding the key issues to be discussed and negotiated in a constitutional process. In the case of our country, there is no doubt that Nigeria cannot carry on for much longer under a bumbling political class and grossly weakened bureaucracy. The center is no longer holding, because the Nigeria-State, its institutions, and political operators have lost their credibility with the people. There are no known social contract binding citizens to their governments. The social capital that once minimally existed among members of society is now vastly eroded and depleted. Are you saying it is possible to have a qualitative governance system in Nigeria without qualitative and informed citizenry?
I think my previous answer to another question shows that it is impossible to run a democracy of uninformed and indifferent citizens and end up with qualitative governance. If a country’s democracy is lacking in the basic features of democratic ethos, values, principles, and institutions, governance will less likely produce good outcomes for the larger number of people. This is what we see in our country. It is why despite all our huge endowment of population, natural resources, and geography, we are the world’s capital of extremely poor people with more than 80 million Nigerians in that category. Nigeria is ranked one of the most insecure countries in the world, the number three spot on the terrorism-ravaged table and 13 on the state’s fragility index. Sixty years after independence, we have an infant and maternal mortality rates that are higher than the average in Africa. We are a country with the largest number of out-of-school children. And by the way, on this matter of Out-of-School children, we did prove that there are sound policy solutions that work to reduce it and get children into the classrooms, especially in the northern states. As minister of education from 2006 to 2007, we reduced the number from about 7million to 6.5 million within one academic session. Today, the number is a painful 13.5 million children growing as illiterate in the 21st century. No, it is impossible for our democracy to deliver qualitative governance without informed, active and engaged citizenry who make a deliberate move to take their center stage in the electoral and governance processes. What I have said of Nigeria is unfortunately applicable in most of the other African countries. It is why by 2035, if we do not #FixPolitics on our continent, more than 90 per cent of the world’s remaining poor people will be on our continent. That would be a monumental tragedy.
Does #FixPolitics involve holding leaders to account? If so, how could a product of rigged election say a lawmaker, be held accountable, for instance?
Yes it will; election is not the end game in a democracy. Voting at elections is therefore only a part of the duties that citizens have for staying eternally vigilant and demanding accountability from those who exercise delegated authority on their behalf. The political literacy programmes for both the middle and low income class must be designed to support post-election engagements — that is during the time that governance commences after elections— of citizens to hold those they voted into office, or against; to account for the performance of their public responsibility.
The #OfficeOfTheCitizen was identified as a credible initiative to empower such citizens’ actions. When you have more citizens in the constituency that delegated their authority to the kind of lawmaker you described, they will more probably become accountable. Why? They will because there is a disincentive of the credible threat of recall by united citizens in their constituency, working successfully together to remove the lawmaker. Not even the most perverse National Assembly can survive the pressure from a persistent citizens collective action.
Based on this grand agenda of sanitising democracy, which country serves as a realistic model to emulate and is that possible within the social limitations in Nigeria, viz, educational attainments and income levels?
First, from my research, no country’s democracy is perfect and taken for granted as having attained. This is absolutely crucial to note by those who assume that democracy has a destination, which when a country arrives, the citizens can then rest and “leave the institutions to work”. No, it does not work that way. Constant participation and vigilance is the only way a people can preserve their democracy and keep it working for their wellbeing.
Second, no country fully resembles Nigeria; not even Indonesia, which shares a significant range of similarities with Nigeria. So, if we are to learn any lessons at all, it is this. We the people, the citizens are the ones with the right to gather around the table and design the functional democracy that serves all our people well."
I don’t wanna be a civil servant,https://guardian.ng/opinion/i-dont-wanna-be-a-civil-servant/,"About a decade ago, I bought a collection of Christian evergreen songs.  One of the songs was my favourite.  But I did not get part of a particular song right. Trust little children-they made it up for me by interpreting it as ‘I don’t wanna be a civil servant’. But I knew that this was not what the singer actually sang. Later, I realized that they were probably passing a message to me about their impression regarding the Civil Service. After over three decades in the Federal Civil Service, and retirement from the Service, I have come to the realization that the kids were right, just like other ambitious and enterprising youths, from across the country whom I have met, who do not see the Civil Service as an ideal place to seek a long-term career for growth and fulfillment in life.  To them, the Civil Service is a killer of visions, dreams and noble aspirations. But how did we get to this stage? In trying to unravel this mystery, following his appointment by President Olusegun Obasanjo as the pioneer Director General, Bureau of Public Service Reforms (BPSR) in 2004, Dr. Goke Adegoroye, tasked himself with answering two questions namely: ‘What is it in the mainstream Civil Service that kills initiative, and frustrates talents; and ‘What is it about the Civil Service that seems to make it go in circles that lead nowhere? These questions, and more, are contained in his paper titled ’Challenges of a Public Service Reforms Administrator: An Analysis of the First Year’ in ‘Nigeria Public Service Reform’- ‘The Vision and Challenges’.  Dr. Adegoroye bowed out of the Civil Service providing veritable answers to these questions which did not sufficiently resonate well with the establishment. He has not relented, though. Other champions and guardians of the reform process, including former Heads of the Civil Service of the Federation, Governor Nasir el Rufai, Dr Ngozi Iweala, Oby Ezekwesili, Nuhu Ribadu and experts such as Professors Ladipo Adamolekun, Jide Balogun, Dele Olowu, Victor Ayeni, have also provided pathways for changing the focus and drive of the Civil/Public Service without success. Undoubtedly, the damage to the Civil Service, from its resistance to change, and be fit for purpose, is deep, devastating and hurting. Without any sustained and appreciable efforts to urgently remedy the situation, the Civil Service, especially the Federal Civil Service, is destined for a fatal crash from which it may never recover.        As a nation, it seems that we have suddenly forgotten that, once upon a time, the Nigerian Civil Service was among the best institutions in the Commonwealth of Nations. And, thankfully, then it impacted on the nation in many profound ways. Perhaps, we still need to be reminded about the role of the Civil Service, as succinctly stated by Chief Obafemi Awolowo, of blessed memory, in his book – ‘The People’s Republic, wherein he states that: “the importance of the Civil Service in any society cannot be over-estimated. Without the civil servants, Government programmes would not even be worth the paper on which they are written, and momentous Government pronouncements would only amount to so much ‘sound and fury, signifying nothing. Indeed, a proficient and incorruptible Civil Service is the most valuable asset with which a country can be blessed…Now, if we are to succeed in rearing a breed of efficient, upright and objective civil servants, we must see to it that their entry into, and promotion within the Service are absolutely governed and dominated by sheer merit, and totally free from every taint or semblance of political influence, nationalism, tribalism and nepotism’.  In line with the above enunciation by the late sage, a reform initiative was launched in Nigeria after the re-establishment of democratic governance in 1999.  The Public Service component of the change programme took off fully with the establishment of the Bureau of Public Service Reforms (BPSR) in February 2004, as the expert house and institutional champion of the reform programme. The overarching objective, as stated in one of the reform publications titled, The Obasanjo Reforms, is ‘to build a first class service whose performance is substantially enhanced, with added capacity, for enforcing ethical standards, and instilling a sense of core values and principles for promoting good governance and sustainable democracy’.  A further aim is to build the capacity of the Service to enable it perform the respective roles of providing ‘guidance in policy making, assistance in policy planning, policy advice to Ministers and other Functionaries of Government, building and communicating institutional memory to decision makers, guidance and management of resources required to accomplish policy objectives, delivering quality public services, establishing standards and enforcing norms, and measuring, monitoring, evaluating the performance of public sector organizations, and other non- government agencies rendering services on behalf of Government’.   Unfortunately, today, we are in dire straits.  The Civil Service is absolutely diminished. The governance architecture of Ministries, Extra-Ministerial Departments and Agencies (MDAs) are not built around functional systems, processes and procedures- but on imperial lords of different colourations. Political correctness is the order of the day, at the expense of manifest courage to speak truth to power. The system does not welcome diversity/systems thinking and innovation. The merit principle has virtually disappeared from the firmament of the Service.   Large numbers of officers across all levels are completely frustrated. Welfare packages are poor. Remuneration is low. Officers bribe their way to secure promotions and deployment to ‘juicy’ positions. Thanks to the Dr Ingawa-led new team in the Federal Civil Service (FCSC) where a new culture of due process, accountability and transparency is emerging to stem this tide. The commanding heights of the Service are dominated by politically exposed and highly connected transferees, at the expense of more experienced and competent in-service career officers.  Being courageous comes with a heavy price, hence a culture of silence, timidity and bootlicking reigns in the Civil Service.  Even directors have become little boys and girls who must appease the godfathers and mothers, within the system, in order not to be left out in the distribution of patronage and privileges.   Indeed, the highest level to which a civil servant can aspire in the Service- i.e. the post of a Director-is almost meaningless, being of no significance in many contexts. The consequence is that the system is deprived of the breadth of experience of courageous officers in the Service who are shut off in the decision making process aimed at providing enduring and cost-effective solutions to the myriad of governance challenges confronting our beloved nation because they cannot play the ‘yes’ game of other servile officers in the system. The confidence and trust gaps between political masters and core civil servants have widened in the mistaken belief by political masters that their team of advisers, usually procured at a heavy cost to government, can be a suitable replacement for the Civil Service.  And they, with their aides, often impact the system negatively by setting up parallel systems of public administration and management, in their respective Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs), because of the permissiveness of the system, given that their excesses are not checked, but are often rewarded handsomely, in spite of the fact that they have acted in breach of their terms of engagement. Leadership selection in the Civil Service is also at variance with the helicopter view of Lee Kuan Yew, the founding father of Singapore. As espoused by him, in his best seller From Third World to First, the major ingredients of this leadership model are an ability to perceive problems from a wider horizon and to seek solutions by identifying and zooming in on critical details. In other words, leadership entails an ability to think through issues in a comprehensive and detailed manner. Other critical factors which he identified as germane to leadership are courage, determination, commitment and character, thus reaffirming the truism that a diminished Civil Service is one without deep thinkers; one without a sense of purpose, whose vision, drive, passion and added capacity to serve efficiently, effectively and competently, are  blurred and  permanently impaired. On the contrary, and in the typical Nigerian way of life, we choose leaders through a narrow, counter-productive and almost worthless examination-based system, which is often rigged and manipulated in favour of preferred candidates.  Nigeria truly deserves a World class Civil Service of distinction, pride and excellence, anchored on the four core principles of Stewardship, Trust, Engagement and Professionalism (STEP), as enunciated by Ms. Amal Pepple, CFR, former Head of the Civil Service of the Federation, as part of the legacies she bequeathed to the Federal Civil Service.   Surely, Nigeria needs a recalibrated reform programme, with measurable performance indicators, and capable institutions for the delivery of the anticipated outcomes of the change initiative. It must no longer be an institution where we invest more on the lousy, the indolent than the deep, the gifted and the exceptional. It must be an institution of first, and deliberate, choice- not the last option, by any means. Obviously, Nigeria needs a Civil Service that can attract a new generation of the brightest and the best to its system, without any inhibitions. Nigeria does not deserve a Civil Service where Lilliputians dominate the space of enlightened leadership.  Certainly, Nigeria needs a revamped Civil Service made up of officers of uncommon pedigree who are giants in loyalty, knowledge, foresight, integrity, character, commitment, determination, purposefulness, patriotism, courage, candour, innovation, amongst others. And civil servants  must heed the clarion call of Abhijit Naskar in ‘When Humans Unite: Making a World Without Borders’, by repositioning themselves as serious allies and partners of Government, and other key stakeholders, in the development process. They must realize, as he has rightly said, that: ‘On your shoulders, lies the responsibility of humanity’s present and future. If the armed forces are our last line of defence in every corner of the world, then you are our first line of defence in every corner of the world. Injustice must ask your permission before entering the lives of the people. You, civil servants are the first vanguards of the society’.    So, are we still in doubt about the progressive and life-transforming role of the Civil Service as a force for advancing the cause of our shared humanity, and enabling Nigeria to claim her position of pride and distinction in the comity of nations?  I hope not, because we can only continue to deny this reality to our shame, gloom and inglorious end. By the way, the world will not wait for Nigeria forever to justify her importance and fulfill her glorious destiny, hence the need for us to act fast, bearing in mind that there is no virile nation without a virile Civil Service. A word is, indeed, enough for the wise.  Mayomi is a retired director, public commentator and analyst. "

Between politics of petrol subsidy and deregulation of downstream sector,https://guardian.ng/politics/between-politics-of-petrol-subsidy-and-deregulation-of-downstream-sector/,"The regime of fuel subsidy came into Nigeria since 1973 to cushion the impact of importation at a time the government failed to maintain the nation’s refineries despite growing demand for petroleum products. With the introduction, government fixes pump price and balances the additional cost of petroleum products, especially Premium Motor Spirit (PMS) under a scheme seen as a way to reduce poverty. Though Nigeria is the leading oil producer in Africa boasting of about 37.2 billion barrels of proven oil reserves, the country is sadly the only member of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) that still imports refined fuel. While no less than N10.7 trillion was spent on petrol subsidy between 2006 and 2019, Nigerians, who are living in extreme poverty, only witnessed continuous increase, as the country eventually became the Poverty Capital of the World last year. Besides, in the past few decades, petrol subsidy is usually more of a political discussion and decision than business or economic justification or sense. This development may not be unconnected with the half truth and political statement that the only thing the Nigerian masses benefit from the country’s rich oil resources remains the shortfall government settles on every litre of petrol and that taking it away means the masses would totally miss out. Indeed, since Nigerians believe that the pump price is inextricably connected to the prices of most commodities, especially food stuff, transportation as well as energy, the issue becomes a high score game for political actors, who win or lose support base on their take on petrol subsidy. But the scheme has variously been criticized by economists, civil society organisations and other energy experts, who insist that the development is crippling Nigeria’s fragile economy, as it remains a conduit pipe for corruption and that it hinders the growth of the downstream sector of petroleum industry. To underscore the burden of the scheme on Nigeria’s economy at a time when oil price was relatively fair and provided opportunity to save for hard times like the country is currently experiencing, Nigerian government under Goodluck Jonathan transferred $10.85bn from the Foreign Excess Crude Account to pay for subsidy between 2011 and 2014. Though the administration of President Olusegun Obasanjo had attempted to limit what government paid as subsidy by gradually increasing the pump price of petrol as successive governments removed subsidy on diesel and kerosene. In 2012, the Jonathan-led government came under intense criticism as it tried to remove subsidy. A socio-political protest movement, tagged ‘Occupy Nigeria’, started across the country from Monday, 2 January 2012 in response to the planned fuel subsidy removal. The decision witnessed one of the country’s greatest agitations as protesters gathered in Lagos, Kano, Abuja, Minna, and at the Nigerian High Commission in London. It also brought civil disobedience, civil resistance, strike actions, demonstrations, and online activism, with Nigerians demanding that the pump price of petrol remain at N65. During the attempt in 2012, leaders of the current ruling party, All Progressives Congress (APC), scattered across different opposition parties, including the defunct Action Congress of Nigeria (CAN), Congress for Progressives Congress (CPC), All Nigeria Peoples Party (ANPP) and All Progressive Grand Alliance (APGA) openly condemned and protested the removal. President Muhammadu Buhari, former Education Minister, Oby Ezekwesili and APC leader and former governor of Lagos State, Ahmed Bola Tinubu, and other prominent personalities supported the protest and sued for the continued payment of subsidy. But on assuming power in 2015 and a little while later, the APC government began to see what the Jonathan administration saw and began to agitate for the removal of subsidy; this was despite removal not being part of the party’s campaign promises. After the oil price crash of 2015, the Buhari-led government reintroduced subsidy as soon as it noticed the oil price rebound, a development which would have drastically increased the pump price. To a lot of experts, subsidy is drainpipe through which corrupt Nigerians milk the country dry. They say it lacks transparency and accountability, as the payment had at some points been made without budgetary allocation thereby denying civil society organisatuions as well as the media the mechanism to monitor payments.  Many believe that the regime of subsidy is responsible for the continuous neglect of the country’s four refineries, which currently perform at an average of 5.55 per cent of their combined nameplate capacity of 445,000 barrels per daily (bpd). In March last year, Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) stated that the refineries, which are located in Port Harcourt, Kaduna, and Warri recorded deficit, with losses for the period under review rising to N16.03 billion. The Kaduna Refinery specifically recorded a deficit of N5.09b, Port Harcourt, N5.37b, and Warri N5.56b in March, against a combined revenue projection of N7.7b during the month. Seeing that the current outbreak of Coronavirus has drastically reduced global oil price and made funding of the 2020 market a difficult task, the federal government through NNPC, again announced an end to payment of subsidy. But most stakeholders have expressed concern over the development. Some of their worries included government’s inability to address the infrastructural challenges that have long bedeviled the downstream sector of the nation’s petroleum industry, especially lack of refineries, pipelines, road network and other inherent challenges that could skyrocket the price of the product, thereby adding to the overall cost. Indeed, with the looming scarcity of foreign exchange due to the low oil price at the international market and projected recession in Nigeria’s economy, some private players have already expressed fears that removing subsidy could return Nigeria to the days of long queues due to scarcity of the product. Similarly, stakeholders are calling for understanding on the roles that would be played by the Petroleum Equalisation Fund (PEF) Management Board as the agency also provides some subsidy. Experts insist that there is no clarity on what the government plans to do to ensure oil marketers continue to access foreign exchange and not a situation that would give preference to some players. WHILE stakeholders continue to canvass for a deregulated downstream sector, where market forces drive demand and supply, the current development is being seen as unclear to most industry players. This is against the background that a similar pronouncement was made in 2015, but government cleverly reintroduced subsidy payment, tagging it as under recovery thereby making NNPC the sole importer of refined products. Group Managing Director of NNPC, Mr. Mele Kyari, had said the era of subsidy on petrol is gone forever, adding, “Subsidy and under-recovery are zero today. And it is zero forever.” However, the APC-led administration had in 2015 touted that subsidy was removed on petrol as Vice-President, Yemi Osinbajo, then said the fuel subsidy removal had lifted the burden of not less than N15.4 billion monthly from the federal government. The development could account for the reasons the immediate past President of Nigerian Association for Energy Economics (NAEE), Wumi Iledare, sees the current move as an announcement designed only for the pages of newspaper and just wishful thinking. For him, the power to set petroleum product price is in the Petroleum Act, adding that the development might not be about subsidy, but the power to set petroleum product price. According to Iledare, “The only challenge is the amorphous nature of governance of the energy sector generally with a lot of institutional limitations. Another minister or president may come and disregard previous government’s executive order on product pricing issue. A look at Petroleum Products Pricing Regulatory Agency Act is also crucial and the PEF Act. There must be an Act of NASS to remove price control by regulations or by an executive order of a populist government.” Iledare, who is Ghana’s National Petroleum Professorial Chair in Oil and Gas Economics, stated that the ignorance of consumers makes the path to full deregulation much more difficult to achieve. “We said kerosene and diesel are deregulated, but the price is still high even at this extreme low crude oil prices,” he submitted. “Without proper education of the public, the myth that deregulation will lead to higher PMS price is a hindrance. Deregulation must not be like a thunderbolt but gradual and with legislative commitment to rules of law. That was what the PIGB was set out to do.” Major Oil Marketers Association of Nigeria (MOMAN) recently shared the view of Iledare, rejecting price modulation and demanding for full deregulation of the market. MOMAN Chairman, Tunji Oyebanji, had specifically noted that oil marketers would rather opt for deregulation as against price modulation as the former would bring about long term stability in the downstream sector. It further recommended a repeal of the law setting up Petroleum Equalisation Fund (PEF), stressing that the cost of administration of equalization was too high and the unequal application of payments by marketers distorts the market and creates market inequities and unfair competition. Just as the situation was in 2016 when the price of crude went down, MOMAN believes that government would find it difficult to increase pump price due to political reasons, thereby insisting that purchase costs and open market prices should not be fixed but monitored against anti-competitive and anti-trust abuses. Indeed, National President, Petroleum Products Retail Outlets Owners Association of Nigeria (PETROAN), Dr. Billy Gillis Harry, believes that most of the decisions recently taken by the government in the industry were only announced on the pages of newspaper without carrying the key stakeholders along. Harry told The Guardian that full deregulation at a time when Nigeria is currently dependent on importation of refined petroleum products in place of domestic refining despite four refineries remains worrisome.  “If bridging claims are expected to stop, how will the consumers in the hinterlands meet their petroleum products requirements?” he asked. “How will transportation of petroleum products be safely and efficiently handled as against the current epileptic nature of trucking and marine deliveries occasioned by bad roads and piracy? The NNPC’s pipeline network is totally not operational. What are the measures put in place to make the pipelines work efficiently and effectively?” These are questions Harry is yet to find credible answers to. Founder and Principal Partner at Nextier, Patrick Okigbo, insisted there was need for more clarity on the plan to ensure there were no loopholes in the proposed plan. Patrick, who was unclear about the level and extent of the reform, noted that the current development was still quite ambiguous, but that it would be lasting legacy for President Buhari if he became the leader, who finally ended the 47-year-old culture of waste. “We need to understand the role PEF will continue to play in the industry as that is also a kind of subsidy,” Okigbo said. “There is no clarity on what the government has done to ensure oil marketers continue to access foreign exchange. If NNPC is exiting the market, there needs to be clarity on whether the marketers will get dollar at the same rate that NNPC did, which I do not support, or whether they will be subject to the same conditions as other product importers such as rice importers.” To set the sector on the right path, Okigbo insisted that neither NNPC nor oil marketers should get dollars from Central Bank of Nigeria at any discretionary rates, adding that the playing field should be the same for all players in the oil market. “It is possible that international crude oil prices could rise and the naira could slump against the dollar,” he noted. “All of these could translate to high pump prices. It should not get the government to return to the wasteful subsidy regime. Rather, it should think through how to use the funds that would have been wasted in subsidy to improve infrastructure to assuage the increase in pump prices.” Okigbo also raised questions about transparency, stressing that the template and indices used to determine PMS price should be made public. Another energy expert, Michael Faniran, stated that there was need to repeal the law establishing PEF through the long delayed Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB) that has suffered many setbacks or another bill. He also stated that the template for petroleum pricing by PPPRA must be made public, reflective of market rates and transparent to secure public trust. Like Okigbo, Faniran noted that unless oil marketers get foreign exchange at market rates government would end cross-subsidising According to Faniran, “We need to ensure that NNPC does not get undue advantage as a competitor to other marketers. There must be clarity about the modulation process. Normally, I expect this to be done on a quarterly basis so that it allows marketers enough time to sell their vessels. “Also, I expect a price band (or range) and not a single price as PPPRA has been doing now. The lower end of the price should be what it should sell in areas like Lagos, which is close to the production reception ports, and the max limit could be price it could sell in far hinterland areas like Sokoto, Borno, etc. “This will promote competition end eventually bring the price down. If a marketer decides to sell at upper limit in Ibadan, for example, the other station across the road could sell at the lower limit to gain advantage.” Faniran noted that there was need for a downstream regulator, stressing that what is currently in place is a pricing regulator.

ACPN threatens court action against Ezekwesili over campaign funds,https://guardian.ng/news/acpn-threatens-court-action-against-ezekwesili-over-campaign-funds/,"The Allied Congress Party of Nigeria (ACPN) has threatened to sue its former presidential candidate, Oby Ezekwesili over the party’s campaign funds, saying she should render accounts of money spent while canvassing for votes across the country. Its National Chairman, Ganiyu Galadima, who spoke at a media briefing in Abuja yesterday, noted that the accounts of expenditure Ezekwesili rendered fell short of expectations. He, therefore, threatened to approach the courts to seek an order of mandamus compelling her to return all funds generated during her short stay in the party. He accused Ezekwesili of sidelining key party officials like the National Treasurer and Financial Secretary on money generated from when she emerged the party’s presidential standard-bearer until she withdrew from the race. His words: “We are rejecting everything she had submitted. We want to know all the content of the accounts and see the account because at the end of the day, it is not Ezekwesili the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) will hold responsible, but the party.” “Whatever any candidate generates for campaigns belongs to the party. And so, we expect her to respond at the appropriate time, but if she doesn’t, we may be compelled to go to court to seek an order of mandamus. “For someone, who was contesting for presidency to have generated N43 million in three months and spent everything herself, is suspicious and unacceptable. She could not even disclose the sources of funds and how much she was able to generate. “We want to know full disclosure of the accounts she opened because when you look at the statement she provided, there are four different accounts, which we didn’t know anything about.” Galadima cited the case of Omoyele Sowore, who publicly disclosed on national TV that his campaign generated about N99 million and also told the world how the money could be traced. “So why is there no transparency in Ezekwesili’s project? That is the bone of contention,” he added.

Oby Ezekwesili publishes campaign finances,https://guardian.ng/news/oby-ezekwesili-publishes-campaign-finances/,"Former presidential candidate of Allied Congress Party of Nigeria, ACPN, Oby Ezekwesili, has released her campaign finance breakdown showing the income and expenditure between October 1, 2018, and February 2, 2019. Despite pulling out of the presidential race about a month to the poll, Ezekwesili spent about N48 million in a space of five months for the 2019 presidential campaign. The spokesperson of the Obiageli Ezekwesili Presidential Campaign Organisation, Ozioma Ubabukoh, said via a press statement that she withdrew from the race to build a viable coalition. “This decision followed extensive consultations with leaders from various walks of life across the country over the past few days. I deem it necessary for me to focus on helping to build a veritable coalition to ensure a viable alternative to the #APCPDP in the forthcoming elections,” Ubabukoh had said. The breakdown published on Ezekwesili’s campaign website show she raised N48,957,416.00, $17,645.00, and £200 between October 1, 2018, and February 2, 2019. During that period, the campaign spent over N12 million on travels, N10.6 million on media and publicity, and another N15.3 million on “campaign mobilization fees, meeting and logistics costs”. Printing of campaign posters and other materials cost the campaign a total ₦ 1,222,920.00, the breakdown shows.  Ezekwesili said  ₦2,435,609.81, $12,634.50, £200.00 are left in the campaign bank account.  In a country where campaign finances are absolutely opaque, the move by Ezekwesili to publish her the financial record drew applause from many. However, the national chairman of the party, Alhaji Gani Galadima, who had earlier led party leaders to disown Ezekwesili and adopt the candidacy of President Muhammadu Buhari, alleged Ezekwesili of mismanagement of campaign funds. Galadima said that the statement of account she sent was unacceptable.  Speaking to journalists in Abuja, ACPN chairman charged her to emulate other candidates as regards transparency in campaign funds, stating this case was not the #BringBackOurGirls project which she championed.  “It is the right of the party that must submit report on campaign fund and expenditures to have all the information in the spirit of transparency and accountability in line with (s.92(3)) of the Electoral Act as amended,” Galadima said."
Silent grumbling shaping northern voters’ slant,https://guardian.ng/politics/silent-grumbling-shaping-northern-voters-slant/,"If there were any caveat about analyzing or forecasting the probable outcomes of the forthcoming presidential election, it would be this: Do not mind the atmospherics.  Some pundits seem to be looking at two flexible indicators as they attempt to frame the likely scenarios and voting patterns for the presidential election.  These elastic indices include the 2015 tally in the contest between former President Goodluck Jonathan and the incumbent President Muhammadu Buhari as well as crowd enthusiasm and turnout at current political rallies.
 


  
A significant point of departure in the impending electoral contest from the Jonathan presidency is the fact that quite unlike the near unanimous desire of the north to have the presidential seat returned to the zone, this time around, the prominent candidates are from the north.
 
However, going down to the grassroots, it is easy to notice the seething anger among the electorate in the north, especially among the downtrodden who are their numbers.  Although most northern youth seem comfortable with the return of premium political power to their region, they appear nonplussed as to the net return from that position to their state of social wellbeing.
  
After a tour of the north, which is considered to be home to a greater percentage of registered voters, it is obvious that northern electorate are divided on such issues as President Buhari’s performance in office, capacity for economic rejuvenation, as well as security and national stability. Security/national stability
WHILE Nigerians from the southern part of the country accuse President Buhari of concentrating Federal Government appointments in the north, most northerners express worry that things are not moving well in their region.  The refrain among young men and women in Kano, for instance, is that abu ba ya tofia (commercial activities are not moving) as they complain about how things stand in the country.
 


 
But among the three broad subdivisions of the voting population, including the almajirai, educated young people and the elite, the increasing spectre of insecurity is a source of common worry. They wonder how, despite the President’s military background, the military under his watch could not stem the tide of incessant attacks and killings that have made life unpalatable in the region.
  
The president is also said to be favouring the Northeast geopolitical zone at the expense of other geopolitical zones that make up the north, just as Christians in the same Northeast maintain that Buhari has continued to marginalise them in terms of appointments and government patronage.
  Some of those who accuse the president of religious bias against Christians in the Northeast point to the travails of the former Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF), Babachir David Lawal, who they allege did not do anything different from what the Chief of Staff, Abba Kyari, has also been charged with.
 
On a bolder relief, instead of commendation, the president is blamed for the deep-seated division and inter-ethnic hate among the diverse groupings in the country, a development they said has helped to envelop the country with much apprehension as the general election draws near.
 
A strong issue is also being made about the religious sensitivity in the north, which has brought about a new dimension to the latent denominational differences between the various Islamic sects in the region, especially between Sunmi and Izala.   
Economic/social revitalisation THE popular sentiment among the masses in the north is that the Buhari administration ushered in hunger and penury despite the much talked about Anchor Borrowers’ Agricultural initiative.       
 


 
Most of the distraught young persons, especially those without basic education that have been living on free income from politicians say they do not understand why Buhari is canvasing that when he becomes president he would take away extra vehicles from wealthy individuals that have more than one vehicle and leave them with just one while the rest would be distributed among the poor.  Such grandiose but unmet expectations of utopian welfare system or socialist redistribution of wealth are prevalent among the poor masses in the north based on the mythical rehash of Buhari’s years as a military head of state when warehouses were broken and essential commodities distributed to the people.
 
Perhaps, it was out of being overwhelmed by those massive and lofty expectations from his administration that Buhari seemed to have been lost for six months after his inauguration.  Unwittingly, in the campaign to defeat Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in 2015, Buhari and the leaders of All Progressives Congress (APC) built castles in the air, as they churned a manifesto of utopian programmes.  
  
APC and President Buhari have been trying to push back on the many unmet expectations on the grounds that the preceding administration squandered all the huge accruals from oil in the past 16 years.  But somehow the people do not seem to see the nexus between their present socio-economic condition and the argument of wasted years.  What is not lost on the people is why the president did not do any tangible thing for six months only to wake up six months to the end of his four years to talk about TraderMoni just because he wants another four years in office.
 
As the northern electorate remains confused by the lack of cogent explanations and clear outline of what President Buhari could offer if elected for another four year-term, the masses remember the years of PDP without concrete assurances on how the better life promise could come ab
out, but it did.
 
Again while the post-convention and primary election controversies and crises dog APC’s campaigns, the PDP, which enjoyed a magical comeback, does seem to offer vibrant competition.  Candidates of the opposition party have not been pushing, as hard as if they are hungry for votes should do.  There is no doubt that funding has been an issue, especially with the ruling APC using the anti-graft agencies to stalk potential donors and political investors that could ordinarily have thrown some money in support of the candidates. Even the old method whereby high networth contractors and businessmen contribute to the campaign funding of frontline rival parties has been minimal or absent.  However, the sluggish look about the campaigns could be traced to the incidence of vote buying, as the big parties seem to be conserving funds for late pitch with voters.  Referendum on Buhari’s performance
EITHER because they have not been well communicated or the paltry nature, many of the northern electorate that voted with enthusiasm for President Buhari and APC in 2015 displays a sort of languor whenever the issue is raised about who to vote for in the forthcoming election.
 
Despite the massive throng of people at campaign rallies by the political parties, voters’ preferences go deeper.  In making up their minds on who to vote for among the presidential candidates, many people think President Buhari has not done much to deserve another term, pointing out that his health condition could be responsible for that.
 
Concerning the fight against corruption, most people who said they have collected their Permanent Voter Cards (PVCs) said although they have been hearing about the fight against corruption, they don’t understand how it has helped to ‘repair’ the economy.  While it is obvious that much public enlightenment about government’s policies and programmes have not been undertaken by government agencies, political parties have not fared better.
 
Voters recall how Buhari said he has never been as sick as he was when he travelled on a long medical vacation to London and his disclosure that the doctors advised him to eat properly and sleep plentifully.  Northern electorate recall those statements and feel that those pushing the president to seek another four years in office are not doing so for the interest of the north, just as they said it would not augur well for their region for them to encourage a situation similar to what happened in 2010.
 
President Buhari’s wife’s disclosures that her husband is no longer in charge of government activities and that two powerful persons have commandeered the execution of powers in the presidency contribute to the silent conservations about the coming presidential poll.  Yet some northerners, especially the elite, express worry about the PDP presidential candidate’s promise to restructure the country. They worry that it would affect the fortunes of the region, stressing, however, that the reality of northern legislative majority would check any adverse policy proposition to tinker with the political structure of the country.
  
It is also among the elite that complaints are rife about the lack of clear actionable plans for sustainable development in the region in the Buhari Presidency, particularly policies that address challenges of abject poverty, skill acquisition, neo-natal and maternal health and out of school children.
  
The look on faces of most northern voters suggests a deep desire for clarifications on what President Buhari has achieved in office.  It is evident that the common people are confused, as they prepare to elect a president to pilot the affairs of the country in the next four years.
 
A notable Emir confided in The Guardian that unlike the southern part, the north does not make noise on critical issues of national politics. He disclosed, “as we speak (late December 2018) those people you see running around chanting slogans still see the election as between Buhari and Jonathan, but a few days to the election they would be told where the wind is blowing.”
  
Nevertheless, the typical belief that northern votes determine the ultimate outcome of Nigeria’s presidential election might not hold true this time around.  The dynamics of voting in the region seem to have been greatly altered by the aftermath of 2015 election and APC’s governance style and politics in the past four years. Demographic revolution
WHEN he signed into law the Not-Too-Young-To-Run bill, President Buhari jokingly pleaded with young voters to delay its activation till 2023.  But that admonition seems not to have cut any ice because in the course electioneering for the 2019 polls, there have been many manifestations that defy further wait.
  
The Nigerian political economy has shown an urgent need for recalibration and the old order seems not to be providing plausible panaceas.  Add to that, events in other democracies have young persons elected into office, with new knowledge driving leadership and governance innovations.  Furthermore, the appearance on the scene of some promising young leaders including Omoyele Sowore, Fela Durotoye, Madam Oby Ezekwesili and Prof. kingsley Moghalu, helped to introduce a new dimension to the country’s democratic experience.
  
Signs of a possible demographic disruption in the forthcoming election emerged recently when a northern youth group, the Northern States Christian Youths Forum for Peace and Equity (NCYFPE) endorsed the presidential candidate of Young Progressives Party (YPP), Professor Kingsley Moghalu ahead of the 2019 general election.
  
In a letter titled ‘Letter of Endorsement,’ signed by its national president, Apostle Paul Adamu, NCYFPE described Moghalu as the most qualified candidate and “a consummate grassroots personality, God-fearing man with courage and stamina that steam from a trained mind.”  
 
While stressing that they have strategised effectively to deliver millions of votes of Christian youths from the three northern geo-political zones to YPP, the group reiterated: “There is no candidate more qualified to be President of Nigeria in 2019 than Kingsley Moghalu, whose experience, sound orientation and fierce commitment to democratic ideals put him head and shoulders above the rest.” Similarly, Middle Belt stakeholders endorsed the presidential candidate of Peoples Trust (PT) Gbenga Olawepo-Hashim, saying that President Buhari has failed to justify their support for him in 2015.  The final word on this year’s general election would be how the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) delivers the verdict of Nigerians through a transparent, credible, peaceful, free, and fair process."
2019 presidential debate as eye opener,https://guardian.ng/opinion/2019-presidential-debate-as-eye-opener/,"The 2019 presidential debate by the Nigeria Elections Debate Group (NEDG) and the Broadcasting Organisation of Nigeria (BON) which held without the two leading presidential candidates, President Muhammadu Buhari of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and Atiku Abubakar of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) left much to be desired. However, the redeeming streak came from Fela Durotoye of the Alliance for New Nigeria (ANN); Kingsley Moghalu of the Young Peoples Party (YPP); and Oby Ezekwesili of the Allied Congress Party of Nigeria (ACPN) who took part in the debate. As usual in this milieu, the public was regaled with sundry excuses on why the leading candidates were absent from the exercise. Spokesmen of Buhari averred that task overload of the president who was on campaign tour to Niger State made it impossible for him to attend a programme for which he was duly invited. The PDP’s presidential candidate on his part made it to the venue and departed shortly without participation, arguing that he would not be part of it since the incumbent was not present to address his scorecard over which they would have debated. In his words, “We came here for a presidential debate, not a candidacy debate, and I, Atiku Abubakar cannot challenge or question an administration where the man at the helm of the affairs of the nation is not present to defend himself or his policies. After all, you cannot shave a man’s head in his absence. I do not believe in attacking a man who is not here to defend himself…” Although he saw the absence of Buhari as a slight on Nigeria’s democracy, his walking away amounted to the same thing. Above all, he lost an ex-cathedra opportunity to sell his programme to the electorate, the final arbiter in the democratic game. Indeed, the concept of democracy often sounds beautiful. Recall the definition by Abraham Lincoln: government of the people for the people and by the people. Or Karl Marx’s definition: the solution to the riddles of all constitutions. Take another step and look at the libertarian values: freedom of expression, political franchise—vote and be voted for; freedom of association; popular sovereignty and periodic, free and fair elections among others. Beyond these core values, democracy has aesthetics; it is beautiful and it is embedded in the sheer symbolism of the process; somewhat ornate nature which adorn the very process of democratic realisation. One of the process of adornments is the campaign, a process of socialisation of the electorate to the competing ideas about how to run the country for the wellbeing of its citizens through open rallies and organised debates among contestants for public offices. For the reason that the electorate constitutes the audience, it is a shared experience, educating and edifying. Being the entertaining façade of democracy, people look forward to it. More important, political debate provides the basis for the rational choice of the citizens in terms of who to govern them. Perhaps, it is only illiberal and quasi- democratic regimes that seek to evade this process because they have scant regard for their citizens, whom some scholars of democracy qualified as citizens of low intensity. Presidential candidate of the Nigeria’s opposition party Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Atiku Abubakar (Photo by PIUS UTOMI EKPEI / AFP) While we note there is no law that says there should be a political debate in Nigeria, debate has become a tradition and a socialising norm for the democratic process. Political debates in modern times drew from Abraham Lincoln-Stephen A. Douglas debates in the United States in the nineteenth century. The “debates helped establish the precedent that candidates should present their cases and state their criticisms before the public, and engage in a constructive dialogue with each other about the future course of the nation.” They have been restructured overtime to become an unwritten norm of the liberal democratic tradition globally. They are a platform for political engagement with the citizens. The significance cannot be over-stated with the advent of technology for mass communication. In advanced democracies, politicians ignore it to their own detriment. But it is no less important in democratising formations. Therefore, the absence of the two leading candidates is contemptuous of the citizenry. Perhaps the incumbent feels entrenched that it can win the elections without the electorate. To be sure, the country missed an opportunity to listen to their future leaders as well as the basis for rational choice. Persons who cannot process and articulate ideas before the public about how they intend to run the affairs of the country are not qualified to govern the country. The conclusion of the whole matter is that the absence of the front-runners in the presidential debate is disrespectful for the country. Nevertheless, the efforts of Durotoye, Ezekwesili and Moghalu are to be applauded. At least, on their part, they offered Nigerians a window into the basket of key policies cutting across, infrastructure, health, education, security and agriculture that they would pursue to move the country forward if elected. The deliverable from the participation of the younger generation candidates is that their active participation has put a lie to the sophistry of the members of the old setup that there are no viable alternatives to the old, tired foxes who have been recycling themselves since independence. Now the coast is clearer and we can see a glimmer of hope – from the young political debaters.

Debate dodging,https://guardian.ng/opinion/debate-dodging/,"On December 14, 2018 the nation watched with rapt attention the five Vice Presidential Candidates on a debate platform beamed to Nigeria and the world. There was a grand exchange of knowledge and ignorance, logic and illogic and the fatuous attempt at public deception through false statistics peddling. But we enjoyed the exchanges and the feeling that for a few hours those who run our affairs or desire to do so in a vice presidential capacity were answering our queries. We expected that on January 19, 2019 when the big masquerades, the presidential candidates, were billed to take the debate podium we would get a full flowering of their views on the Nigerian condition and their thoughts on how to make this beleaguered country better, much better, than it is now. In aviation parlance there is something called “No show”, meaning that the passenger did not show up for his flight. On that day, only the three new faces in presidential politics Kingsley Moghalu, Oby Ezekwesili and Fela Durotoye showed up. Candidates Muhammadu Buhari and Atiku Abubakar were missing from the podium. Buhari said he was busy with governance and that the debate collided with some other matters of state. His second reason was that he has been appearing at other platforms and dishing out information on the performance of his government. On the other hand Abubakar appeared at the debate venue briefly and disappeared when he learnt that Buhari was not coming. Both men showed enormous disrespect to and disdain for Nigerians. This debate was announced several weeks earlier and the alleged clash of schedules is an unacceptable excuse because this is an important national event that takes place only once in four years. Yes, candidates contesting elections always use various platforms to market themselves and their vision. Such platforms include town hall meetings, campaign rallies, interviews on radio, television and newspaper and campaign documents including party manifestoes. But nothing beats the reach of a television platform where the debate is fed to most television and radio stations in Nigeria and abroad. If Buhari arrogantly ignored the debate Abubakar should have done himself a favour by honouring his party and wooing Nigerians with whatever ideas he had for making “Nigeria great again”. Whoever advised him to walk away did a great disservice to him because that was a golden opportunity for him to crack the whip on Buhari’s back. Atiku’s proverb about not shaving a man’s head in his absence is grossly inappropriate here. If you can shave a man’s head in his absence go ahead and shave it. He missed a gift –edged opportunity to slaughter his major opponent and to let Nigerians know that he respected them for offering him an opportunity and honour to speak to them. Such remarks would have resonated very favourably with Nigerians. Historically many of Nigeria’s presidential candidates have been serial debate dodgers. In 1999, Olusegun Obasanjo of the PDP refused to square up with Olu Falae of the APP/AD Coalition. In 2003, Obasanjo (PDP) refused to debate with Buhari of ANPP. In 2007, Umaru Yar’ Adua (PDP) refused to debate with Buhari of ANPP. In 2011, Goodluck Jonathan did not agree to face Buhari of the Congress of Progressive Change (CPC). In 2015, Buhari of APC refused to have a debate with Jonathan of PDP. The excuse, we learnt, was that the questions to be asked at the debate had been leaked by the organizers to Jonathan. This allegation was, however, unsubstantiated. In general, it appears that those who refuse to participate in debates are those who always believe that victory was already in their pockets and they had no need for a debate. But in most democracies debates are a desideratum. They provide the best opportunity for candidates to market their programmes and for voters to assess them properly. In a two hour television debate it is possible for the viewers to measure the candidates’ temperament, comportment under pressure, knowledge, discipline, ability to convey their vision clearly and convincingly. In the US. debates count for much because undecided voters use the performance of the candidates at such platforms to decide on who to vote for. When President George Bush (senior) was contesting for the second term as U.S. President he kept looking at his watch during the debate with his opponent Bill Clinton. Polls conducted after the debate showed that many Americans felt offended that Bush was arrogant and impatient (by looking at his watch) and felt that the debate was unimportant. Many of them voted against him on that account. He lost the election. Such apparently minor gestures may count in America but may not be of much consequence to Nigerians. But even if the candidates believe that they do not need debates to win elections, they should respect the fact that Nigerians want these debates and want to see how their leaders will grapple with their various problems. Yes, it is true that politicians have other platforms through which they deliver their messages. One of them which seems to be the favourite of the politicians is rallies where there are always huge crowds. Most of those fellows at the rallies are hired while some of them are party supporters. If you are talking to party supporters you are merely preaching to the converted. Those who are hired are the same fellows who attend the rallies of all the other parties for a fee to give the impression of a mammoth support for the party in question. This charade goes on all the time and no discerning analyst is deceived by these mammoth, tumultuous, crowds. What they are looking for at those rallies are wrappers, rice, salt, cash which you can give the generic name, stomach infrastructure. Those rallies go on forever with singers, drummers, acrobats on display and just a few minutes for speeches which people hardly hear or listen to. Those are not the venues for making seminal statements of policy and they are never made on those occasions. One on one interviews on radio, television or newspapers have limited coverage because they are restricted to only the medium in question. So the long reach of a television debate that is widely covered on several platforms is a candidate’s best friend although it can also be his worst enemy. Why do Nigerian leaders dodge debates? They do so because they have no respect for the people they rule or want to rule. They do so because they see themselves as the people’s bosses, the lords of the manor. They do so because they are arrogant and disrespectful of their people. They do so because they have no real interest in the trappings, ethos, the culture, the antecedents and the spirit of democracy as it is practised in countries from which we borrowed the system. In America, no presidential candidate would fail to show up for a debate at elections and hope to be voted for. Here the candidates ignore the debates because they think they can win the elections by hook or crook, debate or no debate. But there is a lot to be gained by both the debaters and the country. The television debate at which Dr. Kingsley Moghalu, Mrs. Oby Ezekwesili and Mr. Fela Durotoye appeared was quite revealing. They all showed intelligence, knowledge, a mastery of the major issues that afflict Nigeria and possible solutions. Those who have reacted to their views praised them for their grasp of the lay of the land and the road to salvation. It is unlikely that any of them will win the election but we now know that with them around the reign of the gerontocrats will not be long. We have the hope that if all of them stay in the trenches the country stands a chance of having people at the apex of governance whose views are knowledge-driven and who can lead Nigeria into modernity. They are the leaders of thefuture. So the public may begin to feel that despite the deficiencies of today, there are good prospects of their being overcome tomorrow by a new generation of leaders who are likely to hug diversity, inclusivity and new knowledge as the tools for a country that is hungry for greatness. That is still some kilometers away. For now, we must persuade the presidential candidates of APC, Buhari and PDP Abubakar to commit themselves to a debate before the February 16 election. They owe themselves, their parties and the voters that. No excuses for absence are good enough. It is not about them and what they are comfortable with. It is about the country they are leading or want to lead. They have no right to tell Nigerians that they do not want to get involved in a debate for whatever reason when Nigerians say they want them to square up against each other and put their visions on the table. Buhari will be running the race based on his record in the last three years plus as well as his vision for the next four years. Abubakar will account for his tenure as Vice President and also give us an insight into an Atiku presidency if he wins. Those are the things Nigerians want to hear in a structured debate format free from rabble rousing, heckling or cheering. The Nigeria Election Debate Group is registered for the purpose of such debates. Together with the Broadcasting Organisations of Nigeria (BON) they have enough credibility despite the crass partisanship of some BON members to earn the respect of contestants. Nigerians must insist that the debate culture be accepted by all those who seek to run our affairs because that is a viable way of knowing who we want to entrust our destiny to. Anyone who refuses to show up at a properly organized debate is simply showing disrespect to Nigerians and the office he seeks to hold. And Nigerians should pay them Back in their own coin.

2019 presidency: After debates what next?,https://guardian.ng/politics/2019-presidency-after-debates-what-next/,"Two Saturday’s ago, the grand stage was set for the Presidential debate, which was yet another opportunity for the leading candidates to discuss the key governance ideas driving their respective ambitions. For the fresh faces in the race, it was a much coveted national moment, a time to assail the record of the establishment politicians, while pitching their own key points for policy formulation and implementation. In line with their strategic calculations to discredit the current establishment elite, the so-called new breed politicians craved for a big national debating stage, which would serve as a platform to make the call for action on the need for a generational shift in the politics of Nigeria.
 
As the newcomers were relishing the opportunity to make mincemeat of dominant party candidates, the wily grandfathers in the political space had other ideas. The establishment politicians generally scoffed at the idealism and what they branded as the naïve posturing of the younger elements. As such, they mocked the new breed politicians for having no ground game, which could significantly change the political equation. President Muhammadu Buhari and his All Progressives Congress (APC) saw no practical political gains to derive from the debates, and as such stayed away. And then to deflect the criticism which would come from their dodging a major debate, the APC bluntly made the point that there was nothing to gain from the President debating with “motivational speakers.” Another top APC administration official derisively likened a debate with the other candidates as the President debating with “political dwarfs.”
   
Although the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and its candidate, Atiku Abubakar found a convenient excuse that President Buhari did not show up to walk out on the debate, there is no doubt that the decision was driven by the same brinkmanship, which made the APC stay away.  Therefore, while it is true that the candidates who stayed away denied the electorate the opportunity to have a little more information about the thinking of the two major candidates, the snub is a direct message to the younger politicians seeking generational power shift. Put in another way, the governing and major opposition parties, the APC and the PDP redrew the rules of engagement. Their decision to refuse to mount the debate podium is a clear message to the effect that the new breed politicians running on the basis of ideas, and lofty ideals should perish any thought of sniffing the Presidency until they are serious enough to build an effective political movement on the ground.
 


   
The establishment political parties were therefore much more interested in pragmatic calculations, which would swing the pendulum of political power in their direction. The APC and the PDP saw the debates, not in terms of bringing forward new ideas, which would radically alter the direction of governance. The two major camps saw the debate as a continuation of the adversarial catfight to determine who gets the maximum political advantage. As if to confirm the comments of the establishment parties, which basically imply that they stand no chance in the race to win the Presidency, some of the new breed politicians began considering a withdrawal from the race.  Last week, Presidential candidate of the Allied Congress Party of Nigeria (ACPN) Oby Ezekwesili dramatically withdrew from the Presidential race. It was a move that jolted supporters and political observers alike because it called to question the seriousness of the presidential project all along. The fact that her party went on to immediately declare support for the re-election of President Buhari equally gave the impression that the new breed actors were merely serving as proxy candidates of the establishment parties. Added to this is Ezekwesili’s new found push for a coalition, which is being viewed as yet another distraction, given the fact that the election is just less than three weeks away.
   
What appears like the meltdown, and incoherent coalition chatter in the camp of the new breed politicians notwithstanding, the debate-dodging strategy of the major parties is still in the public spotlight. The major direct messages on governance were provided by the new breed politicians because they still went ahead to have a robust conversation on the fundamental issue of how to change the direction of governance. Both in their policy documents, and through the debates, the candidates from the fringe parties have contributed some important ideas, which should not end at the debating podium.
 
For the two major candidates who refused to show up, there could be wisdom in taking a look at the specific solutions, which have been put forward by the new generation of politicians. This becomes a compelling point because democracy and the democratic process present opportunities for a society to renew itself. If as with the case in Nigeria, that renewal in terms of a generational shift in politics is not possible immediately, the idea would be to explore other options for renewal. One way could be to bring on board fresh policies capable of changing the impact of governance. For instance, Kingsley Moghalu, who says he still in the race, and packs a lot of valuable experience as a former Deputy Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and an international development expert, reeled off some interesting ideas during the debate around how to solve some major issues facing the country.  On the much talked about diversification of the economy, Moghalu, who is running on the platform of the Young Democratic Party (YPP) talks about the need to tap into the ICT revolution to create opportunities in the rural areas. His thesis is that the non oil sector would be an immediate beneficiary of such a move, just as the jobs created would impact the most vulnerable citizens who live in the far flung rural communities of the country. On his part, Fela Durotoye of the Alliance for New Nigeria (ANN) was very vocal about the need to push the cultivation of Nigeria’s arable land from what he describes as the current 37 percent to 50 percent. What that implies is a serious expansion in the agriculture sector, and a giant leap in terms of jobs.
   
Significantly, the ideas, which have come from the ‘outsiders’ in the 2019 presidential race, if taken up and implemented by the eventual victor in the election, could help improve the fortunes of the country in certain critical areas. This point is important because one common thread running through the messages pitched by the candidates who debated was the need to urgently revamp the economy. Therefore, no matter the limitations of their candidacy, in terms of not possessing the solid political structures to cause an upset, the new breed politicians must have also done some observation and consultation to understand the issues affecting the Nigerian people the most. Another reason the ideas put on the table through the debate podium must not be overlooked is that the candidates have presented their solutions on the basis of the diversity of their experiences. 
   
For the ruling APC, the economy has remained the Achilles heel due to the slow performance that has been experienced, in addition to the job losses many citizens have experienced. As the APC grapples with the task of fixing the economy, if it is triumphant in 2019, it should not shy away from embracing productive and effective ideas, which could help solve the problems. The ruling party can also pick a thing or two from the strategies being canvassed by the politicians anchoring their aspirations on the call for a new leadership paradigm for Nigeria. Also, the party in charge of government, if it gets elected next month, cannot overlook suggestions that have been made relating to how to revamp Nigeria’s security architecture to enable it respond to the many threats the nation faces on a daily basis.
   
Interestingly, the idea is that one party may not have all the answers to the challenges; after the elections, it would be helpful for government to sit back, reflect and pick up some of the practical ideas and strategies, which have been distilled from the campaign trail. Therefore, irrespective of the modest gains made by the government in power, the reality is that there are a lot of areas requiring attention. There will be a lot of benefit for the Nigerian system with the realization that no government or party has the monopoly of wisdom and ideas to fix the country.
     
Part of the reason for the abandonment of ideas distilled through debates and conversation during the electioneering period, would be found in the zero sum nature of Nigeria’s political system. The fact of the winner taking all, no matter how good the ideas of the loser are, makes it difficult to find an accommodation for useful points, which have been made in the course of discussing the future of the country. Bi-partisanship is required in a lot of respect, especially when it comes to ensuring government delivers the best social goods for the vast majority of the people.
  
For instance, the major opposition party, the PDP is anchoring its campaign on jobs. As an opposition party angling to defeat the ruling party and win political power, the tendency is to downplay its own weaknesses, while shouting more about the perceived areas of strength. The former Vice President has for example been quick to point at a report that Ghana had overtaken Nigeria as the top destination for Foreign Direct Investment. The PDP candidate goes on to note that it is of particular importance to “understand why Nigeria has become an economic pariah under the present administration leading to us becoming the world headquarters for extreme poverty.”
   
Atiku’s diagnosis is that the problem comes from President Buhari’s habitual travel abroad where he allegedly de-markets his own nation and its economy. He said: “It is further exacerbated when that same leader stubbornly blames his predecessors for problems he caused, while at the same time taking credit for achievements and progress initiated and delivered by those same leaders he makes a habit of denigrating. Economic challenges will bow only to proper agenda.” In a recent statement, the former Vice President goes on to blame the incumbent for focusing more on propaganda, which he says has no effect on the economic problems, and will only make a bad situation worse.
 


 
As for his idea for addressing the problem, the PDP flag bearer vows that if elected President, he would be Nigeria’s Chief Marketing Officer. Although, the solution put forward, the idea of the President being the nation’s chief marketing officer, is short on specifics on how exactly this would translate to investment inflows, the idea raises a point on the need for whoever wins to effectively brand the country whenever he or she is in the international arena. On the flipside, the Buhari and the APC have tended to anchor their push for an improvement in the fortunes of the economy on ensuring the business environment becomes friendly and conducive for investors. This is probably the reason why the APC has tried to draw attention to Nigeria’s improvement in the World Bank Ease of Doing Business rankings. In the ranking released last October, Nigeria placed 146 out of 190 countries. The reality is that any agenda to revamp the economy would have put such gains in the proper perspective. For there to be progress, any of the partisan camps, which wins the context come February 16, would have to ask deep questions about how to explore the benefits in such modest progress. Any party that wins, if it is serious about making impact would need to find ways to understand what even an opponent has done well, by ensuring such milestones translate to real benefit for the ordinary citizen.
   
One of the major lessons to learn from the 2019 campaign is that partisanship after the electoral contests are won or lost should be geared towards an improvement of the system. All partisan camps are supposed to be driven by the ideals enunciated in the fundamental objectives and directive principles of state policy of the 1999 Constitution as amended.

Ezekwesili reacts to ACPN’s allegations,https://guardian.ng/news/ezekwesili-reacts-to-acpns-allegations/,"The former presidential candidate of the Allied Congress Party of Nigeria Dr Oby Ezekwesili has denied all allegations made against her by the party in the aftermath of her withdrawal from the presidential election. Ezekwesili withdrew from the race on Thursday citing the need to form a viable coalition viable enough to wrestle power from both the ruling All Progressives Congress and leading opposition People’s Democratic Party. “As for the defamatory statements made against my person by the ACPN leadership in their malicious statement, I want Nigerians to know that there is NO IOTA of truth in any of them,” Ezekwesili said in an emailed statement on Friday. “Everything ACPN wrote or said of the campaign donations is fabrication and outright lies. Our campaign was conducted with the highest level of transparency and accountability with impeccable evidence.” The former World Bank chief said the party’s immediate endorsement of APC’s President Muhammadu Buhari showed why she had to “swiftly depart from their midst” and that the party’s leadership was neck-deep in transactional politics. She insisted that apart from the need to form a coalition, the difference in values and vision between her and the party informed her decision to quit the race. “How could I upon realising the divergence of values and vision with the leadership of the party continue to stand on such a political platform? My abiding vision has been to mobilise citizens to disrupt the old order politics of APCPDP,” she said. On Thursday, ACPN said Ezekwesili did communicate the decision to withdraw her candidature and accused her of using her presidential campaign as a bargaining chip. ACPN said two aides of the former minister Iyinoluwa Aboyeji and Maureen Kabrik – told the party that Ezekwesili was only interested in being appointed a finance minister by the eventual winner of the election holding next month. Both Aboyeji and Kabrik have denied the allegations with Kabrik saying the party was “so unintelligent if that’s d best they could come up with.” Although Aboyeji initially reacted to the allegations against on Twitter, his account was not available on Friday morning. Regardless of the “puerile accusations” against her, Ezekwesili said her push to form a coalition will be fruitful. “Take it from me that WE shall definitely build the Coalition force that will terminate the poverty escalating governance of the two dominant parties in the 2019 election,” she said."
Throwback To When Ezekwesili Was Sure She Could Defeat Buhari,https://guardian.ng/life/whatsnew-entertainment-celebrity-gist-and-so-on/throwback-to-when-oby-ezekwesilis-addressed-her-views-on-politics-in-our-exclusive-interview/," Oby Ezekwesili, the presidential candidate of the Allied Congress Party of Nigeria (ACPN) shocked Nigerians in the early hours of Thursday after announcing that she was withrawing from the 20129 presidential race. Although she was not a hugely popular candidate, Ezekwesili had a conviction that she could upset the status quo. In an exclusive interview with Guardian Life in November, the former presidential candidate was very much upbeat about her chances of defeating the incumbent president Muhammadu Buhari, whom she said has performed woefully. Below is an excerpt from that interview: “This is a Nigeria under President Muhammadu Buhari where the primacy of the human life has been completely devalued…life is cheapened,” she said. “The problem though is that the intention and the outcome are diverged,” she added. “The lives of Nigerians today are not any better because President Buhari became our president. As a matter of fact, the quality of lives has taken a significant beaten,” she told Tonye Bakare, editor, online,  Guardian Nigeria. “The odds are staggering. But she insists that the “fight” for “a new independence from our rapacious ruling class” is winnable. She is very much convinced that she represents millions of Nigerians who are disenchanted by years of failure of the current and past administrations. “I am not running alone,” she says with a definite conviction. “We are all running. This contest is between the political class that has failed over and over against the Nigerian people and the Nigerian people.” But in a country where the voting public is easily ingratiated by quick and fleeting political favours and an entrenched political culture that has done little to curb electoral malpractices, how she will able to best her opponents is yet to be seen. It is impossible that Ezekwesili is unaware of these odds. Yet, she brims with the hope that her dream of repositioning Nigeria for a greater good will be realised. I am the candidate of the people,” she remarks. Read up the full interview here"
INEC faults Ezekwesili’s withdrawal from presidential race,https://guardian.ng/news/inec-faults-ezekwesilis-withdrawal-from-presidential-race/,"The Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, has faulted the withdrawal of the Allied Congress Party of Nigeria’s presidential candidate, Dr Obiageli Ezekwesili, from the race based on constitutional provisions. The Commission said it is impossible for any presidential candidate to withdraw from the race now. According to the timetable and schedule of activities for the 2019 general elections, the last day for withdrawal by candidates or replacement of withdrawn candidates by political parties was 17th November 2018 for presidential and National Assembly elections. “The deadline for Ezekwesili or any candidate in that category to withdraw or be replaced has passed,” said the chief press secretary to the chairman of the commission, Rotimi Oyakanmi in a statement."
Why I withdrew from presidential race – Ezekwesili,https://guardian.ng/news/why-i-withdrew-from-presidential-race-ezekwesili/,"Former presidential candidate of the Allied Congress for Progressive Nigeria, Obiageli Ezekwesili has said her decision to withdraw from the presidential race was to provide a stronger coalition to unseat incumbent president Muhammadu Buhari at the February 16 presidential election. “I have decided to step down from the presidential race and focus on helping to build a Coalition for a viable alternative to the #APCPDP in the 2019 general elections,” Ezekwesili said on Thursday morning. “This coalition for a viable alternative has now more than ever before become an urgent mission for and on behalf of the citizenry.” Ezekwesili, who was a Nigeria education minister and former World Bank vice president for Africa, said it was time to collectively fight for the country. According to her, “I have not hesitated to offer my willingness to step down my candidacy in order to facilitate the emergence of a strong and viable alternative behind which Nigerians can line up in our collective search for a new beginning.” Her decision to withdraw from the presidential race has caused some disagreement with her party, whom she said were against coalition talks with other presidential candidates as Ezekwesili suggested. “Despite disagreements within the Allied Congress Party of Nigeria on these and other issues, I have decided that it is now necessary to show by action and example my determination on this issue by stepping down my candidacy and focusing on building the coalition once and for all,” Ezekwesili said. The party, ACPN, however, disagreed with her claims and alleged that Ezekwesili’s presidential ambition was for her personal gains. ACPN said, “she (Ezekwesili) only wanted to use the platform of the ACPN to negotiate to be Nigeria’s finance minister”. The party thereafter endorsed Nigeria president Muhammadu Buhari for a second term in office."
"ACPN denounces Ezekwesili, pledges support for Buhari",https://guardian.ng/news/acpn-denounces-ezekwesili-support-for-buhari/,"Hours after Obiageli Ezekwesili stepped down from the presidential race, the Allied Congress Party of Nigeria (ACPN), her party, has denounced her and pledged its support for President Muhammadu Buhari. In a statement signed by the party’s national chairman and running mate to Ezekwesili, Alhaji Ganiyu Galadima, the party said Ezekwesili, in fact, had no presidential aspiration but simply used the party to negotiate to be Nigeria’s finance minister. “The reason for calling this press conference is to let the world know about the presidential aspiration of Dr. Oby Ezekwesili, which in actual fact, is not the truth. “I have been put into confidence by one of her aides named lyinoluwa Aboyeji that she only wanted to use the platform of the Allied Congress Party of Nigeria ACPN to negotiate to be Nigeria’s finance minister. “This she did not deem fit to inform the party whose mandate she is holding.” The party insisted that she did not inform them of her decision to step down and had questioned her campaign strategy that lacked “any tangible thing on the ground to indicate any seriousness”. “If you will observe, Dr. Oby Ezekwesili, is the only presidential candidate who was so militant in her campaign without any tangible thing on the ground to indicate any seriousness in the prosecution of her campaign. No campaign secretariat, billboard or great commitment on the ground to indicate any seriousness.” ACPN, thereafter, withdrew their support from Ezekwesili before endorsing the incumbent President Buhari of the All Progressives Congress for a second term. “The Allied Congress Party of Nigeria (ACPN) is withdrawing support for her presidential aspiration and endorsing the second term bid of President Muhammadu Buhari to take Nigeria to the next level. Ezekwesili had told the Guardian in an exclusive interview last November that she joined the race because of the constant need for the masses to choose between the lesser evils. “I never had interest in politics. Anyone who knows me knows that I detest politics,” she said. “But I had to get to the place where listening to the political class say to us that we have to choose the lesser of two evils got me infuriated.” The former World Bank vice president for Africa in the announcement of her step down from the presidential race said that her decision came after “extensive consultations with leaders from various walks of life across the country”. “I have decided to step down from the presidential race and focus on helping to build a Coalition for a viable alternative to the #APCPDP in the 2019 general elections.” She said she chose to step down despite disagreements within her party. “Despite disagreements within the Allied Congress Party of Nigeria on these and other issues, I have decided that it is now necessary to show by action and example my determination on this issue by stepping down my candidacy and focusing on building the coalition once and for all.” The party also told their former presidential candidate to return to the party donations she has been receiving from all over the world. The secretary of the party, Paul Isamade, revealed that she told them she had received $5000 and N35 million in local donations. “Whatever she had received belongs to the party and we must render account to the Independent National Electoral Commission INEC. So, it is mandatory. We are aware of all the accounts she and her aides had opened for this election to which donations were made”, the party said."
Nigerians React To Oby Ezekwesili’s Withdrawal From The 2019 Presidential Race,https://guardian.ng/life/nigerians-react-to-oby-ezekwesilis-withdrawal-from-the-2019-presidential-race/," A few weeks to the 2019 Presidential elections, the Presidential aspirant and one-time Guardian Life cover subject, Oby Ezekwesili has stepped down from the race. The Allied Congress Party of Nigeria (ACPN) candidate who prides herself as the “candidate of the people,” explained that her recent move is because she deems the candidates of the PDP and APC as unfit to rule the country. Hence, her option of forming a coalition against the parties for the better of Nigeria. “This coalition for a viable alternative has now more than ever before become an urgent mission for and on behalf of the citizenry,” she said. This new move has left Nigerians shocked. It should be recalled that Ezekwesili who was seen as a viable force told Guardian Life in November, 2018 “I never had interest in politics. Anyone who knows me knows that I detest politics. But I had to get to the place where listening to the political class say to us that we have to choose the lesser of two evils got me infuriated.” It is debatable that this statement may be an underlying factor that may her reconsider her decision. On the other hand, this announcement has left tongues wagging: Nicholas Ibekwe @nicholasibekwe: So Oby Ezekwesili has stepped down from the Presidential race and is calling for a coalition to defeat the ruling All Progressives Congress and the former ruling party, the Peoples Democratic Party. Do you think this call for a coalition is too late? Onye Nkuzi (@cchukudebelu): Atiku was supposed to debate Fela Durotoye, Oby Ezekwesili and Kingsley Moghalu. The first two are already out of the race; so he didn’t miss out much by not participating. On a serious note – winning elections requires some planning, its not enough to be passionate & sincere. Bhadmus Hakeem @Bhadoosky: Mrs Oby Ezekwesili withdraws her 2019 Presidential candidacy. Thank you for putting the people of Nigeria 1st. I’m proud to be part of the few who believe we need a new way of doing things in Nigeria. I hope a viable 3rd force will come soon. As for me, I am tired of the oldies. AJ | Adonai Jonathan @Mrmanhere_: Oby Ezekwesili stepping down this close to the February election just goes on to prove that the Nigerian politics is a joke. And if you choose to die for the sake of any politician, you’re the biggest fool around Suzzette @queensuzzette: Oby Ezekwesili bows out of Presidential Race, Madam Oby has just destroyed the hopes of Nigeria having a female president niightmares 🦋 @naiightt: I’ve always said it, the easiest way to defeat this #APCPDP dominance, is only if Oby Ezekwesili , Fela Durotoye, Kingsley Moghalu and Omoyele Sowore all join forces, instead of sharing their votes amongst one another. After all, they are all in it for the progress of the nation. Her opposition Fela Durutoye who has hinted that he might be joining the consensus coalition had this to say: I have always believed that leadership is about service & sacrifice & today, I would like to commend Dr. (Mrs) Oby Ezekwesili for leading the charge to forming a viable coalition to presenting a Consensus Candidate for the 2019 Presidential elections. Festus Keyamo, SAN @fkeyamo: Thanks, ACPN, for seeing the light we saw long ago. We beseech the respect ed Oby Ezekwesili to join hands now with PMB. The coalition we need in Nig is a coalition against corruption, not a coalition against any political party. PMB is already leading the pack against corruption"
"Buhari, Atiku shun presidential debate",https://guardian.ng/news/buhari-atiku-shun-presidential-debate/,"• Moghalu, Durotoye, Ezekwesili Steal Show, Announce Plans For Economy, Security
• ‘Busy Schedule Kept Buhari Away’ • I Can’t Debate Buhari In His Absence – Atiku The much-awaited 2019 flagship presidential debate at the behest of the Nigeria Elections Debate Group (NEDG) and the Broadcasting Organisations of Nigeria (BON), yesterday took place with the major dramatis personae, President Muhammadu Buhari of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and his major challenger, Atiku Abubakar of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) shunning the exercise. While Abubakar arrived the country few hours before the debate, he nonetheless left the Transcorp Hilton Hotel venue of the event following Buhari’s glaring absence. The running mates of all the five presidential candidates, however, participated in the vice presidential debate, which took place on December 14. Buhari absented himself from the debate the way he has done with all presidential debates before the one in 2011. The last time he took part in a presidential debate he squared up against Ibrahim Shekarau of the defunct All Nigeria Peoples Party (ANPP) and Nuhu Ribadu of the Action Congress of Nigeria (ACN). In the end, only Fela Durotoye of the Alliance for New Nigeria (ANN); Kingsley Moghalu of the Young Peoples Party (YPP), and Oby Ezekwesili of the Allied Congress Party of Nigeria (ACPN) took part in the debate, which was anchored by media personality, Mark Segun Eddo. Expectedly, economy, security, healthcare and agriculture formed the major talking points of the debate, just as the candidates marshaled their views on how they hope to revive the economy, tackle corruption, uphold the rule of law and rejuvenate education. Ezekwesili, who said she was not surprised that President Buhari and his PDP counterpart shunned the debate added that the duo had announced their exit from the contest by actions. The former education minister maintained that she remained unwavering in her determination to lift 80 million Nigerians out of poverty, which she promised to do by improving their productivity. Insisting that her government will remove barriers to productivity, ensure conclusive prosecution of corrupt officials, expand the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) and end brain drain in the health sector, she reiterated that her government would make it clear that there is a new sheriff in town, just as she would set up a SWAT team that will be based on intelligence and technology. While lamenting the lack of consequence of the rampant killings on Nigerians, she said she would work towards exploring global collaboration as a way to fight insurgency. Ezekwesili told the nation that to reduce corruption, her party would carry out structural changes in the economy, including deregulation of the oil sector because “deregulation of the oil sector will reduce massive corruption and the incentives that make people run for political office when they have no idea of governance.” In reacting to Buhari and Atiku’s absence Moghalu said he was not surprised, stressing: “They are not here because of arrogance. They believe they can do without you. They believe we are trapped. They are not here because they cannot answer the questions. They are in the class of old politicians that have a sense of entitlements but have no record of performance.” Moghalu, a former deputy governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria who said he would put in place a youth-led government, added that he would reduce government spending by going into a programme of recruitment and training. He revealed that his government plans to recruit six million policemen in four years to tackle insecurity, while corruption in the military would be given a bloody nose. His government, he added would tackle poverty in the North East, which has led to violence in the regions, while also working hard to make “Nigerians feel they are Nigerians.” On how to tackle corruption, Moghalu said his government will ensure that no one is above the law and that there are no sacred cows. “We will give fair treatment to all citizens.” On job creation, he said his government would create incentives for digital work in rural and urban areas through technology. “We will develop a startup nation through the ICT. N500b will be sourced for job creation through the private firms,” he said. On his part, Durotoye faulted APC’s fight against corruption, stressing that the party cannot defend it’s record, else, it would have been at the debate. “The anti-corruption fight is selective and targeted at the opposition. We will make it difficult to steal, strengthen our anti-corruption agencies, as well as, make it easy to get judgment against suspected corrupt people.” Durotoye says his government will ensure proper welfare of the armed forces and the police, and also integrate security intelligence with locals. He stressed the need for a complete overhaul of the curriculum of the education system in order to make young school leavers job-ready upon leaving school. His government, he added would ensure the development of specialisation among teachers. “We will ensure infrastructure and quality environment for education,” he says. He tailored his plan for health towards revamping the Primary Health Care system, adding that the best way to solving the country’s health challenge is by strengthening the PHCs. While walking out of the debate venue, Atiku Abubakar told reporters, “I am walking out because I was expecting to meet the President. The President has been in office for three and half years and he is not here to defend his tenure, so who am I going to debate with? Told that there was still enough time for Buhari to show up, he responded, “If he is on his way, I will come back. In any case, I will have the opportunity to address Nigerians via interviews nationally. I came from the United States because of the debate but unfortunately the President is not here to defend his record.” The Senate President and Director-General of the PDP Presidential Campaign Organisation, Abubakar Bukola Saraki, who accompanied Atiku to the debate venue said: “We have always made it clear to the organisers that our candidate is ready to debate with the President. When we were told in Washington DC that he will be here, we cut our trip short to come here, but we are here, he is not here. Our candidate is ready to debate with the President anytime he is ready” Moments after Atiku departed, he released a statement explaining in details why he walked out of the debate. Entitled “Why I did not participate in the Presidential debate,” the statement, which he personally signed read: “We came here for a Presidential debate, not a candidacy debate, and I, Atiku Abubakar cannot challenge or question an administration where the man at the helm of the affairs of the nation is not present to defend himself or his policies. After all, you cannot shave a man’s head in his absence. I do not believe in attacking a man who is not here to defend himself. As a leader and former vice president of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, let me first apologise to all Nigerians, my fellow candidates and the moderator for the APC Presidential Candidate’s absence in this debate. His non-appearance is a slight on all of us and our democracy. “Secondly, with all due respect to my fellow candidates, Fela Durotoye, Oby Ezekwesili, Kingsley Moghalu and to the moderator Mark Segun Edoo, and with apologies to all Nigerians here and at home expecting an interesting debate, I regret that I will not be able to go on with this debate due to President Buhari’s absence. “I however challenge President Buhari to choose a date and time for a debate where he will be present and I will be there, hopefully with the other candidates as well. Thank you and God bless the Federal Republic of Nigeria” In explaining Buhari’s absence from the debate, APC Presidential Campaign Council, in a statement signed by its Director, Strategic Communications, Festus Keyamo (SAN) said Buhari could not attend the presidential debate organised for the following reasons: “Firstly, out of several opportunities afforded our candidate to interact with the Nigerian people directly by different organisations, our presidential candidate has taken full advantage of another town-hall meeting organized by another group which held on Wednesday, January 16, 2019. He was also joined at that town-hall meeting by our vice presidential candidate who is also the Vice-President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, Professor Yemi Osinbajo, SAN.” The statement titled, “Why President Muhammadu Buhari Did Not Attend the Presidential Debate Organised By The Nigeria Election Debate Group and the Broadcasting Organisations of Nigeria continued said: “Nigerians from all walks of life who were physically present and through on-line platforms asked uncensored questions which were adequately answered. It was also transmitted live by various broadcast networks in Nigeria. “In addition, the busy and hectic official and campaign schedules of Mr. President clashed with this programme. Today, Mr. President commissioned the Baro Inland Water Port in Niger State and campaigned in Niger and Plateau States where his time was over-stretched by the tumultuous and mammoth crowds in both states, (as seen by Nigerians on live television) and only returned to Abuja late this evening. “Whilst we thank the organisers for the invitation, we want to assure Nigerians that we shall continue to hold these debate groups and Nigerians in high esteem, which our candidate has demonstrated during past election debates when he honoured similar invitations. Nigerians will also recall that a few weeks ago, our vice-presidential candidate, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo, also attended the debate organised by the same organisations. “Lastly, we note the statement of the candidate of the PDP, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar who actually came for the event and left the venue when he did not see Mr. President, who is our candidate. According to him, he would not want to “attack” Mr. President in his absence. “It should now be obvious to Nigerians that for Alhaji Atiku Abubakar and the PDP, this election is all about attacking the person and programmes of Mr. President and not about proffering their own solutions to the problems they created during their 16 years of misrule, maladministration and looting of the nation’s resources. When they cannot see President Buhari to attack, the content of their campaign becomes hollow, empty and ‘full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.’ “Now that Atiku Abubakar had a unique opportunity to explain to Nigerians his own vision and mission without a President Buhari in the picture, he ran away. After all, he has his own eight years of crass and grand corruption as vice president to defend before the Nigerian people.

"Only competent leadership can rescue Nigeria from economic collapse, says Ezekwesili",https://guardian.ng/politics/only-competent-leadership-can-rescue-nigeria-from-economic-collapse-says-ezekwesili/,"The Presidential Candidate of the Allied Congress Party of Nigeria (ACPN) and Ex- Minister of Education, Dr. Oby Ezekwesili in Kaduna, said that she would deploy her competence and capacity to rescue the Nigeria from the current socio-economic and security challenges, if voted into office in 2019. According to the Presidential candidate who insisted that the nation has become stagnated economically today because of incompetent leadership, said she had what it takes to solve Nigeria’s complex challenges. The ACPN Presidential candidate spoke to journalists shortly after addressing women, youths, school children and people living with disabilities as she flagged off her presidential campaign in the state. She also addressed hundreds of traders at the Kaduna Central Market, where the candidate urged them to vote out bad leaders in order to save Nigeria. She said that Nigeria had no reason to be a failed state and that it was high time for people of good conscience to rescue her. According to her, she is in the race to safe Nigeria from being led by incompetent leaders, stressing that she is that candidate with competence and capacity to solve the complex problems that had eluded the country for too long. Her words: “When you are tired of mediocrity, the only person who you can think of is Oby Ezekwesili who is offering herself to lead. “We have  lacked  quality leadership in Nigeria. It doesn’t matter that all those that have governed us are men. It doesn’t make any different in quality of life of Nigerian person.  “I am that candidate with competence and capacity to solve the complex problems that seem to have eluded us for so long. We cannot afford to have many more millions of Nigerians to join more than 87 million that are already poor. “What I need is that, this society must be mobilised immediately to see how we can come out of the whole failure and incompetency they have thrown us into.” On security, she said: “We will send signal to those that have been coming to our country to kill our people. Our government today act as if we are a weak country. Those people will get a signal that a new Sheriff is in town.”  On economy, she said her government would be private sector driven economy as practice in other climes, adding: “We will run an economy that is well deregulated where private sector that suppose to be leading will lead. We will make sure that competitiveness and productivity as the hallmark of our private sector,” she declared.

"At debate, PDP, AAC, ACPN, YDP back restructuring, wage increase",https://guardian.ng/news/at-debate-pdp-aac-acpn-ydp-back-restructuring-wage-increase/,"Four opposition political parties, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Young Progressives Party (YPP), African Action Congress (AAC) and the Allied Congress Party of Nigeria (ACPN) have thrown their weight behind the clamour for the restructuring of the country. The parties, who unveiled their agenda aimed at tackling corrupt practices during the #BigDebate series organised by the Centre for Democracy and Development in Abuja, also promised to increase the salaries of workers in the country. A spokesman of the PDP Campaign Organisation, Kassim Afegbua, who represented the party’s presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar, pushed for the restructuring of the country, arguing that such reform would, among others, pave the way for improvement in the provision of healthcare and education amenities. He said his party would increase workers’ salaries. On corruption, Afegbua said: “The global definition of corruption is monopoly plus discretion minus accountability. It’s the monopoly power of an individual that makes him abuse his discretionary power. “What we will do as a government is to ensure that we deny the institutions and agencies fighting corruption of that monopoly power, rather than have a chairman taken from the Nigerian police to head the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) or Independent Corrupt Practices Commission (ICPC). “As a government, once you are able to deal with the issue of abuse of monopoly of power, you will now have to ensure that there are special courts to handle corruption cases, giving the judiciary full independence to be able to take action and conclusively deal with incidences of prosecution and adjudication of corruption cases.  We will also promote the culture of protecting whistleblowers and witnesses.” The AAC presidential candidate, Omoyele Sowore, who aligned himself with the need to restructure the country, promised to pay N100,000 as minimum wage to workers as a means of curbing corrupt practices in the public service. YPP spokesman, Mr. Olawale Martins, who expressed concern over the fate of 13.5 million out of school children in the country, promised to ensure judicious usage of public funds and to review the national minimum wage as well as force those voted into the National Assembly to operate on part-time basis. ACPN promised to take the battle against corrupt practices to places of worship and the traditional institutions, some of whom have formed the habit of rewarding corrupt persons with traditional titles and accolades. Throwing his weight behind the restructuring of the country, the party’s presidential candidate, Oby Ezekwesili, said she would reposition the National Orientation Agency (NOA) to enlightened Nigerians against indulging in corrupt practices. ANRP Presidential candidate, Tope Fasua promised to increase the minimum wage to N45,000 and to ensure increase in budgetary provision to cater for the needs of the citizenry in health and education. At the event anchored by Mrs. Eugenia Abu, the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) failed to send representative to present the party’s position on the issues."
"Ezekwesili flays PDP, APC over insensitivity to Nigerians",https://guardian.ng/politics/ezekwesili-flays-pdp-apc-over-insensitivity-to-nigerians/,"Presidential candidate of the Allied Congress Party of Nigeria (ACPN), Mrs. Oby Ezekwesili, has again criticised the All Progressives Congress (APC) and Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) for being insensitive to the plight of Nigerians. Ezekwesili said instead of embarking on campaigns that would better the lot of Nigerians, both parties were attacking each other over frivolous matters.She spoke yesterday at a stakeholder’s meeting with party members and Yaba Market leaders in Lagos. Ezekwesili, who lamented that Nigeria is now known as world capital of poverty, noted that if elected President she would run an all-inclusive government. The former Minister of Education cautioned that if the issue of poverty is not taken seriously, it could lead to distabilisation of the country.
“Today we are known as world capital of poverty, we overtook India, a country that is seven times our population by having 87 millions Nigerians living in poverty.  “According to the analysis that produced the result, the number could grow and double as our population grows and double. “One thing that we know in the world of development is that poverty could distabilise any country, even if the world of development did not tell us that theoretically, we could see from what happen in the regions where there is prolific poverty,” she stated.

Campaign promises: why media must hold politicians accountable,https://guardian.ng/features/campaign-promises-why-media-must-hold-politicians-accountable/,"In just 39 days, Nigeria will yet again elect another democratic leader to make 20 years, going to 24 years, of uninterrupted democratic governance in the country. It would be recalled that since independence, about 13 individuals have ruled the country, with eight being military rulers. The country’s second attempt at democratic rule was between 1979 and 1983, when the late Shehu Shagari was president. In 1999, Nigeria returned to democracy after 33 years of military rule. Many heaved a sigh a relief from military dictatorship, as democracy offers more open governance and especially for the press, with its attendant freedom of expression and the right to hold government accountable as part of journalistic ethos. Since 1999, it has been argued that the media have been weak and ineffective, as it has not been able to document, track and monitor electoral promises made by candidates during election campaigns and, more importantly, the extent to which such officials at all levels have been able to implement electoral promises while in office. As a result, media owners and managers have been urged to understand that they would be falling short of fulfilling their constitutional obligation if they fail to pay attention to the issue of democratic accountability. They have been tasked to provide the needed resources for their reporters and editors to monitor and document campaign promises and report their findings. According to a resource manual on reporting elections and democratic accountability by IPC, there are national, regional legislations and instruments that provide the context for reporting democratic accountability. These are the Nigerian Constitution and the African Charter on Democracy, Elections and Governance (ACDEG). Section 22 of the 1999 constitution states that the press and other agencies of the mass media shall at all times be free to uphold the responsibility and accountability of the government to the people. And the article 13 of ACDEG says the media should continue to promote political and social dialogue, ensure public trust and transparency between political leaders and the people, to consolidate democracy and peace. In a bid to equip journalists with skills on how to report election processes and hold leaders accountable, the International Press Centre (IPC), with the support of European Union (EU) Support to Democratic Governance in Nigeria (SDGN), recently organised a two- day workshop for 40 journalists in the Southwest on ‘Best Practices and Professional Reporting of the Election Process’ in Osogbo, Osun State. [FILE PHOTO] Dr Oby EzekwesiliEditor of Africa Check, David Ajikobi, stressed the need to report campaign promises critically and requesting evidence from politicians to back their claims, as they are always willing to say and do anything to get into positions of power. He said it was left for journalists to probe more and hold politicians accountable to these promises. He highlighted some of President’s Muhammadu Buhari’s campaign promises in the 2015 election, which ran on the mantra of ‘Change’. Buhari made numerous promises to Nigerians, and Ajikobi argued, “How many of these promises have been realized? How effective has the press been in holding him accountable? He had promised to focus on security, education, unemployment, economy, health care, social security, infrastructure, energy, environment, human capital development, politics and governance, and fight corruption among others.” [FILE PHOTO] Dr Oby Ezekwesili It has also been argued that the president has neglected other promises and has focused only on fighting corruption, which is widely considered the least of Nigeria’s problems. Ajikobi who spoke on ‘Eliminating Biases and Using Fact-Checking Tools and Accurate Reporting of Elections,’ said misinformation, disinformation, opinion and facts are four words that are usually misunderstood, noting, “Misinformation is not given intentionally like disinformation. And while opinion cannot be checked, fact can be checked. Asking questions is the first line of accountability.” Clearly, this year is a critical one for the media as they strive to deliver the above mandates during and after the elections. Ajikobi noted that reporting elections starts in earnest after the elections have been conducted, as a good journalist would be more concerned about the campaign promises of politicians, who emerge winners and “monitor or track campaign promises.” The IPC manual furthers states that, “electoral systems would be more credible and democratic if the media increasingly investigate and report on conduct of politicians. ‘After the elections, seek for timelines for the fulfillment of campaign promises,” Ajiboki stated, “let the public know what has been promised and when they are supposed to be fulfilled. Monitor budget and report on the extent to which it captures or does not capture campaign promises by the president and governors.”

Buhari’s reality on insecurity is different-Ezekwesili,https://guardian.ng/news/buharis-reality-on-insecurity-is-different-ezekwesili/,"The presidential candidate of the Allied Congress Party of Nigeria (ACPN), Oby Ezekwesili, said Nigeria’s president Muhammadu Buhari’s perception of the insecurity in Nigeria is different from its reality. “Each time the President nods his own head for “great work on stemming Insecurity”, one concludes that he is far removed from the reality of what his citizens especially in the North East, North Central and Zamfara & Kaduna in the North West have suffered & STILL SUFFER. Tragic, ” Ezekwesili said. “The Nigerian president Muhammadu Buhari is very UNJUST to his citizens in the way he has failed to Dignify their lives,” she added. Ezekwesili stated this while reacting to a report by Nigeria Security Tracker data that violence has almost doubled since 2017. The report documented 1,949 deaths through October 2018, compared to 1,041 sectarian-related deaths in all of 2017, while deaths related to the Boko Haram conflict through October 2018 are roughly 1,900. Meanwhile, despite the increasing insurgency in the country, Buhari has claimed the jihadist terrorist group Boko Haram has been “technically defeated” in the Northeast. The presidential hopeful, therefore, demanded that the President and Commander-in-chief should immediately render an accurate report of the Counter-Terrorism war and National Security. Ezekwesili also advised the President “to step away from seeing issues of National Security as “arsenals” for his reelection and do the right thing; which is to give all weight to his constitutional duty to protect his country and citizens.” She, therefore, urged the president to “Get Nigeria’s priorities right IMMEDIATELY” “How can we have a leader appears accustomed to losing his Citizens? How, really? No TRUE leader will act the way our President carries on in the midst of such frequent senseless killings of his citizens including troops prosecuting the terrosim war. STOP IT NOW!” Ezekwesili affirmed."
"Ezekwesili, other presidential candidates give conditions for violence-free polls",https://guardian.ng/politics/ezekwesili-other-presidential-candidates-give-conditions-for-violence-free-polls/,"Ahead of next year’s general elections, presidential candidate of the Allied Congress Party of Nigeria (ACPN), Oby Ezekwesili, has given conditions for violence-free polls.  
Speaking yesterday alongside other presidential candidates at an event organised by Presidential Summit Centre (PSC) in collaboration with Forum of Presidential Candidates (FPC) towards  peaceful elections, Ezekwesili listed signing of amended electoral bill and non-interference of security personnel during the polls.    She cautioned that a repeat of military intimidation and harassment of voters, as it happened in Ekiti and Osun states governorship elections would not be accepted by Nigerians during the elections. She, therefore, urged President Muhammadu Buhari to listen to the court of public opinion and address lingering electoral issues ahead of the polls.   “There was a peace accord. In our own case, we signed, not because it was a ceremony but because we believed in it.“We want Nigerians to send a strong message to President Buhari that he must exhibit exemplary leadership quality that will ensure our election does not end up taking the country and the people down.     “And the way to do that is to listen to the court of public opinion, and that is that the country would want to have the best electoral act possible, and the way to ensure we have it is for the President to sign the electoral amendment bill 2018 into law.    “We should, therefore, come together to agree on the rules of the game, as far as the use of military is concerned. We don’t want a situation where the military will carry out a coup from the back door. None of us will accept that,” she stated.    Speaking on Violence-Free Election, spokesperson of PSC, Zara Mustapha Audu, noted that the centre was set up to improve elections in Nigeria by educating aspirants and the electorate on the need for a peaceful elections.   Other candidates that attended the event are, Alhaji Muhammed Shittu (Advanced Peoples Democratic Alliance (APDA), who urged fellow contestants to consider the interest of the nation first.    Also speaking was Dele Babalola of the Base University, who noted that hate speech and fake news could incite violence urged politicians to engage in issue-based campaigns, while security agencies should be neutral during the elections.

I will try my possible best to eradicate poverty – Ezekwesili,https://guardian.ng/news/nigeria/national/ezekwesili-poverty-eradication/,"Presidential candidate for the Allied Congress Party of Nigeria (ACPN), Obiageli Ezekwesili, has pledged to reduce poverty in the country if elected into power 2019. She disclosed during a courtesy visit by ‘Women in Politics Organisation’ to her campaign office on Thursday in Abuja. Ezekwesili said poverty cannot be completely eradicated from the society but she would try her possible best to minimize it through inclusive economic growth and job creation for youths. She said being a woman was not a challenge for her to win the election, adding that she was keen on delivering dividends of democracy to Nigerians. “The unemployment figure in the country is scary, and huge number of graduates come into the labour market every year without jobs,” she said. “Some will argue that gender equality is a deal that cannot be achieved, but I disagree because the society is already moving in that direction,” she added. She also promised to put in place policies targeted at empowering women to tackle poverty. “I will ensure good representation, poverty alleviation and good economic policy for the development of the economy,” she said. She called on youths in the country to shun all forms of vices, and not allow themselves to be used by politicians during and after the general elections."
Ezekwesili calls for more candidates in presidential debate,https://guardian.ng/news/ezekwesili-presidential-debate/,"The standard bearer of the Allied Congress Party of Nigeria (ACPN), Oby Ezekwesili, on Thursday lamented the exclusion of some presidential candidates that were excluded from debate. Ezekwesili, who is one of the female candidates that will be running for the presidential seat during the 2019 general election, opined that it is not reasonable to allow only five candidates to participate in the presidential debates out of many contestants that will be running for the same seat. “As a country with huge contingent of Parties fielding candidates for election, it does make sense to at least allow more than 5 such parties, at least 25 percent of those candidates, to participate in the most influential of Presidential Debates,“ Ezekwesili said in a tweet. Recently, the Nigerian Elections Debate Group (NEDG) and the Broadcasting Organisations of Nigeria (BON) named only five political parties, to participate in 2019 vice presidential and presidential debates. The participants of the debate include Fela Durotoye of the Alliance for New Nigeria (ANN), Muhammadu Buhari of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Atiku Abubakar of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP), Kingsley Moghalu for the Young Progressives Party (YPP) and Ezekwesili. Meanwhile, BON and NEDG excluded Omoyele Sowore of the African Alliance Congress; Donald Duke of the Social Democratic Party; Tope Fasua of the Abundant Nigeria Renewal Party and a host of others candidate from the debate. Ezekwesili said she will like to see one of her opponent, Sowore, in the presidential debate. “I (Ezekwesili) want to see a candidate like Sowore, whose AAC has been diligent in crisscrossing Universities to awaken our young to engage in our Politics.” The former minister of education praised the organisers of the debate for their efforts to get citizens involved in the polls while urging them to include an additional five presidential candidates for the debate. “I also believe that candidates of APGA, KOWA Party & SDP should be part of an additional list of 5 candidates for the Presidential Debate of BON/NEDG, considering their assiduous efforts to galvanize a base of citizens to get involved in these crucial polls.” The presidential debate will hold on Saturday, January 19, 2019, while the Vice Presidential debate will hold at the congress hall of the Transcorp Hilton in Abuja on Friday, December 14, 2018."
"Atiku, Ezekwesili, Duke, Sowore absent as presidential candidates commit to peace",https://guardian.ng/news/atiku-ezekwesili-duke-sowore-absent-as-presidential-candidates-commit-to-peace/,"•I wasn’t invited, ex-vice president insists
•Forum still open for absentees, says Abdulsalami Presidential candidates for next year’s polls yesterday signed a peace accord to be law-abiding before, during and after the exercise. However, the candidate of the main opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Atiku Abubakar, was absent from the ceremony, which held at the International Conference Centre, Abuja. Others who boycotted the event were Oby Ezekwesili of the Allied Congress Party of Nigeria (ACPN), Action Alliance’s Omoyele Sowore, Social Democratic Party (SDP) standard-bearer, Donald Duke and his Young Progressives Party (YPP) counterpart, Kingsley Moghalu. Guests were informed that invitations were sent to all 73 candidates of the 91 registered political parties. Chairman of the National Peace Committee and former Head of State, Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar (rtd), who harped on a peaceful and credible election come February, decried the prevailing insecurity in the country. He cautioned leaders against unguarded utterances, reminding them that their disposition could either make or mar the polls. Abubakar pleaded that peace should override every other consideration, adding that a fair and credible election could not hold in an atmosphere of discord. He particularly condemned recent remarks credited to some religious leaders, warning that the development would not augur well for the nation. The erstwhile Nigerian leader appealed to all the contenders to play by the rule, just as he charged the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to discharge its responsibility creditably. In his keynote address, another one-time military helmsman, Gen. Yakubu Gowon (rtd), described the move as a positive development in the country’s democratic journey. Harping on ‘Trust and Democracy,’ he flayed hate speech, sectionalism and ethnicity, which he said had perpetually kept Nigeria divided with mutual suspicion. Gowon enjoined leaders to judiciously manage the resources of the nation to engender trust, “hope and unity devoid of any bloodshed.” In their goodwill messages, ex-Chief Justice of Nigeria (CJN), Justice Mohammed Uwais, and the Ooni of Ife, Oba Adeyeye Enitan Ogunwusi, sued for peaceful elections and development of the country. Head of EU delegation to Nigeria, Ketil Karlsen, pledged neutrality, urging Nigeria to repeat the feat of 2015."
Ezekwesili promises stable electricity if elected president,https://guardian.ng/politics/ezekwesili-promises-stable-electricity-if-elected-president/,"Presidential candidate of the Allied Congress Party of Nigeria Obiageli Ezekwesili has promised to deliver uninterrupted power supply to Nigerians if elected president in 2019. Ezekwesili, a former education minister under president Olusegun Obasanjo administration said her administration would ensure Nigeria have stable electricity in the first four years of her government. “Our vision is to provide sustainable, affordable and uninterrupted electricity supply to all Nigerian towns and villages, starting with Nigerian cities,” Ezekwesili said in a statement.  Ezekwesili said stable electricity would aid business growth in Nigeria. She explained that “From 1999 till date, all the projections made by successive governments to grow the supply of electricity to Nigerians, to either 6,000MW, 10,000MW or 20,000MW, have not been realised.  According to her, “The  citizens’ desire and willingness to pay an appropriate price of electricity consumed is seen in  generators of all shapes and sizes and how much they pay to operate and service these machines.” While lamenting on the amount of monies companies and business owners spend on powering their businesses, Ezekwesili said her government would focus on the power sector.  She said, “The low power availability from the national grid has meant that corporate entities have to divert a large amount of funds from their core productive areas of focus to this critical area of reliable power supply.” “The price of this is paid in not being competitive and great loss of production capacities, which further impoverishes the populace.” “Our vision is to ensure that the Nigerian electricity supply industry becomes fully functional, vibrant and employs hundreds of thousands of young Nigerians, in both the on-grid and off-grid segments,” Ezekwesili said.  Currently, Nigeria produces 7000 megawatts of electricity according to the government but has been countered by power experts who said the country was still on 3000 megawatts. Ezekwesili said there would be an increase.  She said, “This electricity will be aimed at facilitating and growing business, commercial and industrial activities, in a drive to create jobs and increase productivity. Nigeria’s per capita electricity consumption is among the lowest in the world and far lower than many other African countries,” Ezekwesili said.  However, this was not the first time a presidential candidate would promise stable electricity supply if elected president, current president Muhammadu Buhari administration did the same in 2015. The former governor of Lagos State and current power, works and housing minister Babatunde Fashola in 2014, said a serious government would fix power challenges within six months. Over three years since the election, the power supply is yet to be stable in Nigeria."
Ezekwesili picks Gani Galadima as running mate,https://guardian.ng/news/ezekwesili-picks-gani-galadima-as-running-mate/,"The presidential candidate of the Allied Congress Party of Nigeria (ACPN), Oby Ezekwesili, has picked Abdulganiy Galadima as her running mate for the 2019 presidential election. This was disclosed on Wednesday in Ilorin when the presidential hopeful unveiled her full manifesto themed #ProjectRescueNigeria Galadinma, while reacting to the announcement thanked Ezekweili for her confidence for giving him a very tasking mission to be embarked upon. “As your vice presidential candidate, I want to tell you, your excellency, that I will work with you,” Galadinma said. “I will work with you to go deep down to the grassroots, to move to the length and breadth of the country trying to see to the Nigerian people,” he added."
Oby Ezekwesili: For The Love Of Nigeria,https://guardian.ng/life/oby-ezekwesili-for-the-love-of-nigeria/," Oby Ezekwesili is in the race to dislodge faltering Nigeria’s President Muhammadu Buhari. But a year ago, upending the political status quo in Africa’s most populous nation was, perhaps, only a residual thought; not something she would have loved. Twice a minister, first for education and later solid minerals under President Olusegun Obasanjo, Ezekwesili is not alien to the workings of the government. Her effort to make government procurement processes accountable and transparent as the pioneer head of the Budget Monitoring and Price Intelligence Unit earned her the nickname Madam Due Process. Her penchant for wanting things done the right way was recently acknowledged by a former president of Malawi Dr Joyce Banda. Banda describes how Ezekwesili’s counsel helped her in fighting corruption in her country. “While fighting corruption during my Presidency in 2013, @obyezeks advised me to protect myself with a forensic audit, which UK gov supported. I am forever grateful for this transparent, accountable daughter of Africa, a servant leader pushing for a better Nigeria,” Banda tweeted on November 20. Oby Ezekwesili For someone who was once a minister, an appointment, which is usually a product of political affiliation and patronage, her hatred for politics can be blamed on the rot in Nigeria’s political system. “I never had interest in politics. Anyone who knows me knows that I detest politics,” she says. “But I had to get to the place where listening to the political class say to us that we have to choose the lesser of two evils got me infuriated.” One important driving force behind her decision to cast aside her hatred for politics is the way the human lives have been cheapened since the advent of President Muhammadu Buhari’s administration. Buhari defeated the then incumbent Goodluck Jonathan in Nigeria’s general elections after campaigning to fight corruption, reposition the economy and strengthen internal security, especially in the Northeast. Ezekwesili agrees that Buhari can be given a “little bit of score” for what he has done in the strife-torn region, but insists that a government that allowed Nigeria’s economy to tank on the “back of oil shock” and wrong policy choices should not be allowed to lead the country beyond May 29, 2019. Beyond the downward spiral of the economy which has seen the unemployment rate rise to 18.80 in Q3 2017 when the last job figures were released, Ezekwesili is miffed by the spate of violence across the country and a biased anti-graft war. “This is a Nigeria under President Muhammadu Buhari where the primacy of the human life has been completely devalued…life is cheapened,” she says. “The lives of Nigerians today are not any better because President Buhari became our president. As a matter of fact, the quality of lives has taken a significant beaten.” Her misgiving about Buhari’s handling of the economy preceded her dream of being the president of Nigeria. In 2016, she lampooned the government’s “command and control” economic policies while faulting the intention of the President Buhari to protect the poor. “The president comes into this economic philosophy on the premise that he does not want the poor to suffer. I can relate to that, a leader must not allow the poor to suffer, especially a leader who knows that most of his votes came not from the elite but from the poor,” she said at The Platform, a public policy forum, in April 2016. “The problem though is that the intention and the outcome are diverged.” Obviously, her patience to continue to “relate” to such “archaic” policies ran out. Oby Ezekwesili While Ezekwesili has her mind firmly set on dethroning Buhari when the country goes to poll in the first quarter of 2019, she has to contend with a political culture that is both anti-woman and excessively moneyed. The odds are staggering. But she insists that the “fight” for “a new independence from our rapacious ruling class” is winnable. She is very much convinced that she represents millions of Nigerians who are disenchanted by years of failure of the current and past administrations. “I am not running alone,” she says with a definite conviction. “We are all running. This contest is between the political class that has failed over and over against the Nigerian people and the Nigerian people.” But in a country where the voting public is easily ingratiated by quick and fleeting political favours and an entrenched political culture that has done little to curb electoral malpractices, how she will able to best her opponents is yet to be seen. It is impossible that Ezekwesili is unaware of these odds. Yet, she brims with the hope that her dream of repositioning Nigeria for a greater good will be realised. “I am the candidate of the people,” she remarks. Oby Ezekwesili Ezekwesili is not exactly new to facing down challenges. Her activism preceded the kidnapping of the Chibok girls in 2014. She was a member and the first female leader of The Concerned Professionals Citizens Movement. The group campaigned for Nigeria’s return to democracy in the 1990s. In recent years, she has been one of the most consistent voices against misrule and the excesses of the Nigerian political class. When the Chibok Girls were kidnapped from their schools in April 2014, she became a vocal advocate for their quick rescue. #BringBackOurGirls, a movement which she co-founded adopted a number of approaches -including sits-out and marches – to pressure the then President Goodluck Jonathan to act fast rescuing of the girls. Loyalists of the sitting Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) government accused her of being a paid agent. That led into her passport being briefly seized by the agents of the state when she was travelling to London in July 2014. When power changed hands in May 2015, Nigerians hoped the new government would introduce a new system of doing things. And for Ezekwesili, her travails in the hands of the government took a drastic turn. In January, she and seven other members of the BBOG movement were arrested and detained by police while protesting for the release for the Chibok Girls. In June, her one-man march on the Nigerian State House, Abuja to protest the killings of 100 persons by suspected herdsmen in Plateau communities in June was halted by security operatives. Again, she has been at the receiving end of attacks from loyalists of the current All Progressives Congress (APC), who felt her criticism of the Buhari administration was one too many, and from agents of the PDP, who thought she was beyond being forgiven for allegedly contributing to the party’s losses at the polls in 2015. But Ezekwesili insists her advocacy for the girl child and the woman will not take a back seat in spite of her personal dream of rescuing Nigeria from the grips APC and PDP. “Chibok girls, Leah Sharibu…will permanently remain the basis of my advocacy,” she tells Guardian Life. “The advocacy that we have done concerning Chibok girls and Leah Sharibu is one that is endless. It is never going to come to an end until those girls are back.” And there is always family and friends
Left to her husband, Chinedu Ezekwesili, she would have been into active politics much earlier. He has first-hand experience about how passionate she is about solving Nigeria’s problems. And when she eventually told him that she was going to contest the presidency, there was a eureka moment. “‘Finally, my baby is ready,’ he told me when I told him,” she says. Her three sons, on the other hand, were a bit worried. But they all gave their support to her aspirations. “Our children…they know how totally committed to Nigeria I am. Even though they worry, but on the aggregate, the whole idea is, ‘Mum, go ahead and do this.’” Ezekwesili firmly believes in a family creating a culture that works for its members, without anyone being unduly disadvantaged. “Every family where people act together don’t have to debate who does what,” she says. For anyone to be a functional member of a society, she says, possession of “all the [necessary] skills is important."
Oby Ezekwesili: Running Against Corruption,https://guardian.ng/life/oby-ezekwesili-running-against-corruption/," Since her entry into active politics, Oby Ezekwesili has become one of Nigeria’s mouthpiece. Unlike the characteristic nature of Nigerian public office holders of going into oblivion after serving, Ezekwesili has remained undaunted in ensuring that Nigeria is the country she dreams of. From her times as Madam Due Process because of her radical and transparent approach to eradicating all forms of damaging practices in the government procurement process to giving counsels that is used in different countries administrations to tackle corruption, there is no doubt that the former vice president of the World Bank for Africa is ready for the role as the country’s first position. With her campaign running, she says she never had an interest in politics…”But I had to get to the place where listening to the political class say to us that we have to choose the lesser of two evils got me infuriated,” she told Guardian Life. Speaking on the Bring Back Our Girls Campaign, a committed cause she is known for, she tells Guardian Life her experience including her one-man march. “This is a Nigeria under President Muhammadu Buhari where the primacy of the human life has been completely devalued…life is cheapened,” she says. Ezekwesili is also miffed by the spate of violence across the country and a biased anti-graft war.

"Buhari’s anti-graft war unspectacular, says Ezekwesili",https://guardian.ng/news/buharis-anti-graft-war-unspectacular-says-ezekwesili/,"Presidential aspirant, Oby Ezekwesili, on Wednesday, said that President Muhammadu Buhari has not done any spectacular work in his fight against corruption. While he was campaigning for presidency in 2015, Buhari’s manifesto was hinged on rebuilding the economy, a  strong anti-corruption war and a fight against insurgency. Buhari won at the presidential polls ahead of the then incumbent President Goodluck Jonathan, whose tenure had been riddled with allegations of grand scale corruption affecting even the fight against insurgents. However, three years into his tenure and months before the next general elections, the President, seeking re-election, has been accused of fighting a selective anti-corruption war. The Allied Congress for Progressives Change candidate said the anti-graft agencies including the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) are being used by the president to pick on members of opposition parties. “On corruption, President Buhari has not done any spectacular work,” Ezekwesili told Guardian TV. “What he has done is reduce the fight against corruption to a tunnel vision of EFCC hunting down those who have not joined the APC,” Ezekwesili said. “We are saying that fighting corruption is a comprehensive approach that looks at reducing opportunities of corruption through the kind of structural changes and systemic changes and policies that change the way that governments acts in an economy. “President Buhari has lived below the expectation of the integrity that he told us was his significant point or selling point on the basis of which Nigerians elected him.” Ezekwesili, who plans to unseat Buhari at the 2019 polls, insisted that Nigerians do not have to choose between two evils or choose the lesser evil. “Nigeria needs to be rescued from the entrenched system of politics that is a cyclical pattern of failure. We cannot be choosing any evil. We don’t need evil to fix the conditions that we have found ourselves. We need the right sets of thoughts in development. We need people with character, competence and capacity, who lead not for themselves but for the society,” she said. “I want to be that person that challenges this very artificial construct that Nigeria cannot amount to any good. We can fight and get Nigeria to that place of promise that it belongs.” The Bring Back our Girls convener noted that while there have been gains in the war against insurgency in the North east of Nigeria, the government still hasn’t taken Nigerians to the promised land. “The North east that was mostly occupied by the terrorist is not occupied to that extent. But people have not been able to all return to their neighbourhoods and communities. Lives have not been restored, we still have millions of our people in IDP camps,” Ezekwesili said. “This is the Nigeria under the President Muhammadu Buhari where the primacy of the human life has completely been devalued. Life is cheapened.” She also lamented the poor economic policies of the current government that has led the nation to be named the poverty capital by the World Poverty Clock. “The economy that was on an average growth of 5-6% was allowed to tank on the back of oil shock, but mostly because of very very wrong policy choices. the economic policy choices of the administration has put the economy in dire straits and that is something that we must fight. “The lives of Nigerians are not today any better because President Buhari became our president. The primacy of the human life has taken a significant beating.”"
Personal attacks as nature of presidential campaigns to come,https://guardian.ng/politics/personal-attacks-as-nature-of-presidential-campaigns-to-come/,"As the 2019 presidential election draws nearer, there are indications that the campaign would be characterised by personal attacks and brickbat. Already, opponents of President Mohammadu Buhari are pointing at loopholes in virtually all policies of his All Progressives Congress (APC) government. But what seems to be lacking is clear identification of the lapses and solutions to them. Prominent among the critics in recent time is the candidate of the Allied Congress Party of Nigeria (ACPN), Dr. Oby Ezekwesili. The one-time vice president of World Bank has on every available platform condemned the candidates of both Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and All Progressives Congress (APC), describing them as incompetent and corrupt. She maintained that the emergence of both Atiku Abubakar (PDP) and Mohammadu Buhari (APC) would amount to recycling of ‘political fraudsters’, which has slowed down the economic growth of the country. However, many Nigerians, think that the battle for Aso-Rock Villa is between the two vilified candidates (Buhari and Atiku), given their wide range of experience, political sagacity, structure and financial stamina to woo voters. Ezekwesili thinks otherwise, insisting that such opinion is only for the ignorant, and ought to fade off in the polity. According to her, the thought that some people are in control of some parts of the country, and so, will influence the election, is totally false. Citing example, she noted that the National Leader of APC, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu’s political strength is grossly overrated. Specifically, she noted that Tinubu, who most people think controls Lagos State, does not have control of Alimosho, the largest council area in the state, adding the he was only able to deliver 86,897 votes out of the 650,000 registered voters in Alimosho in the last presidential election. “Tinubu is believed to wield much power in the South-West. He worked for the election of President Muhammadu Buhari in 2015. Tinubu and his like in #APCPDP control only as much as we let them. Alimosho, for example, is the largest council area in Lagos State, with over 1.2 million residents, according to official census figures. In 2015, only about 650,000 of these people registered and obtained their Permanent Voters Cards (PVCs).” She added that it was because the people were faced with the unattractive choice of voting for PDP’s Goodluck Jonathan, or the anyone-but-Jonathan candidacy represented by Muhammadu Buhari, a great many voters chose to abstain from 2015 election. “At the end of the day, they only managed to conjure up 140,000 votes between them, in almighty Alimosho. This says something loud and clear that Tinubu, with all of his ‘might’ and experience in so-called grassroots politics, could, at the end of the day, deliver only 86,897 votes for his candidate Buhari and their party. Where then does the source of this his widely reported power come from? Isn’t he grossly overestimated?” ‘Butiku’
Ezekwesili, in skepticism, described the two parties as Siamese Twins that could not be separated by any doctor. She maintained that for those who have been saying that the 2019 election is anyone but Buhari would be surprised as they would be forced to sing the same song of anyone but Atiku in 2023. She maintained that both parties are not two but a single party fielding one single candidate, “and that candidate’s name is BuTiku. Yes, you heard me right, BuTiku.” She noted that any attempt to choose between the two is like asking somebody to choose between death by poison or death by gunshot. “God forbid. We cannot reject one oppressor and hand over to another. We do not love bondage. We do not enjoy suffering. God in heaven forbid. “I just laugh when I hear some people say our citizens movement will split opposition votes. But the PDP is not in opposition to the APC. The candidate of the PDP has over the past 14 years gone from PDP to AC, AC to PDP, PDP to APC and now back to PDP. These people are brothers and sisters of iniquity and impoverishment, merchants of failure and disappointment. Don’t believe that 419! They are both part of a political ruling class that has held us bound, manipulated and diminished us for decades. “Now they are auditioning to extend their streak of failure for another four years? God really forbid! The real opponent that the Nigerian people have in 2019 is this old political order that takes and takes and takes, and never replenishes anything.” ‘Obytiku’s visit’
Following Ezekwesili’s meeting with one of Nigeria’s former military rulers, Ibrahim Babangida, at his residence in Minna, Niger State, a lot of criticisms from Nigerians have assailed that visit, prominent among the critic is the presidential candidate of African Action Congress (AAC), Omoyele Sowore. Recall that Ezekwesili has been a critique of all previous governments in the country but on Monday, Ezekwesili tweeted that she met with Babangida to discuss how Nigeria must be taken out of the clutches of the old order in 2019. “I had a very candid conversation with former head of state, Ibrahim Babangida, in Minna after my speech on Human Capital Development at El Amin School. I made it clear that Nigeria must be taken out of the clutches of the Old Order. This is our mission,” she tweeted. Reacting to this, Sowore maintained that her meeting with the former military ruler should not have held. “Our dear Ezekwesili wants to stop corruption and mis-governance in Nigeria but then holds a secret session with the Godfather of corruption and bad governance, IBB. Nigerians, Ezekwesili creatively coined BUTIKU. I love it! But this single visit is OBYTIKU.” Ezekwesili warned against derogatory campaign
However, a group of Atiku’s supporters, under the aegis of Atiku for Better Nigeria, has warned Ezekwesili to desist from using derogatory remarks against Atiku and the Peoples Democratic Party, advising her to concentrate on her campaign and stop tagging other contestants and political parties as fraudsters. The group, in a statement by its National Coordinator, Benita Dike-Israel, advised Ezekwesili to learn the ropes in politics so as to avoid “falling into the abyss”. They argued that by painting Atiku and the PDP black, Ezekwesili was indicting herself and biting the fingers that fed her since she was a minister under the PDP regime. “Ezekwesili should learn not to be rude to Atiku or bite the fingers that fed her. For her to say that the PDP and Atiku lack knowledge in economy and (are) into 419 politics is self-indicting. That means her period, as Minister of Education and Solid Minerals added no value to the party that appointed her and to Nigeria as a whole; that also means that her immense credential amounts to naught and (she) has nothing new to offer. After all, a river is as good as its source; for whatever is built on void is void.” The Atiku supporters argued that by joining politics, Ezekwesili, who had been spearheading the campaign for the release of the abducted Chibok schoolgirls through the #BringBackOurGirls movement, had “diluted her fame and goodwill among ordinary Nigerians and friends of Nigeria.” According to the group, people will now begin to see Ezekwesili’s campaign for the release of the Chibok schoolgirls as “a mere ruse, smokescreen and cheap opportunity to feather her own political nest. Whereas it is her constitutional right as an eligible Nigerian to contest the election, yet she should understand politics as a game of persuasion and lobbying rather than (using) pressure group tactics of brick batting and (using) foul language. She can politicise without being rude and judgmental.”

Revisiting the Air Nigeria project,https://guardian.ng/opinion/revisiting-the-air-nigeria-project/,"Sir: When on July 18, 2018 Hadi Sirika, the Minister of State for Aviation, told a large audience, including aviation experts during a diplomatic trip to the United Kingdom of Nigeria preparedness to float Nigeria Air, many were ecstatic about the project. He said, the project was aimed at resurrecting the defunct Nigeria Airways. The project was said to bring about innovation in the Aviation sector of the country. It therefore, came as a quaking bombshell, when it was announced that the proposed project has been put on hold. One continues to wonder if the motive behind the project was well thought-out and planned, as the sudden suspension clearly portrays a wrong approach and perhaps wasteful decision.  Or how do you explain that a project supposedly well planned and driven actively was put on hold due to alleged investors’ apathy? It would be recalled that on July 18, 2018 at the Farnborough international Airshow in the UK, the Nigerian minister of state for aviation announced that the erstwhile Nigeria Airways will be making a return to the skies as Nigeria Air. The minister said the Nigerian government will inject 8.8 million dollars into Nigeria Air as viability gap funding. He said the private sector investors will bring some 300 million dollars as start-up capital.  Obviously, it was shocking when the public got to know that Nigerian Air may not fly for now. Perhaps the project would have continued if only communication was efficient or if knowledgeable Nigerians had been involved rather than the snippets dropped here and there by those in charge. Even the views of the Nigerian air operators were waved off as the experts foresaw loopholes in floating a National airline from scratch, when there were still many deficits on the act. One of the notable Nigerians who spoke against the investment was Oby Ezekwesili, the former minister of Education, who faulted the plan and financial implication of Nigerian Air. The decay of Nigeria Airways commenced in 2003, when planes became flying coffins due to substandard purchase of Aircraft. The Aviation industry has witnessed several losses of lives and property worth billions. Transportation by air became a risk to the masses, everything that could go wrong with the aviation sector did go wrong from the disengagement and payoff of the former staff still pending to the aborted or better still pending project of Nigeria Air. The project will continually be hollow and a mere drain pipe on the public fund at the expense of the Nigerian tax payer as long as the problem in the Air sector is not checked. Having a newly birthed Nigeria Air is a good and welcome development. However, it would have to go beyond Sirika’s optimism and nice words to become an achievable dream.  There must be a renewed commitment from the government and private sector players to see Nigeria Air work out, as Nigeria is a sleeping giant that has been stirred from sleep. The aviation sector is one of the sectors in the country’s economy that can shake up this giant to consciousness if well harnessed and utilised. Therefore, investors with sincere motives should be bought into plan. Also, there should be an agreed plan of such intended and magnificent project just as the place of private public partnership remains valid for this kind of idea. Furthermore, Air Nigeria should go beyond some set of political individuals. We have experts who are Nigerians and will be willing to be part of the think-thank on the initiative and this should be explored totally. Nevertheless, there should be political will to have Air Nigeria rather than vote appeal intention. A laudable project such as Air Nigeria is strategic to the economic growth of the nation and aviation sector. Government should endeavour to resuscitate it. It must not be allowed to die.

"Buhari’s government is corrupt, says Ezekwesili",https://guardian.ng/politics/buharis-government-is-corrupt-says-ezekwesili/,"A speech by Obiageli  ‘Oby’ Ezekwesili, presidential candidate of the Allied Congress Party of Nigeria at a World Press Conference on Monday, October 29, 2018 in Lagos. How can they say that we are finished?
We have just begun.
We have nowhere else to run to.
We have nowhere else to go. Ladies and gentlemen, you are welcome to this conference. When the singer TY Bello released that powerful anthem in 2011, Nigerians were on the march to a historic election. It was an election that showed us a vision of what is possible in our country – that the son of a humble fisherman from a minority tribe in the Niger Delta can rise to become president of the federal republic of Nigeria.The winner of that presidential election described his victory as “the renewal of hope” in Nigeria. And most Nigerians believed him.Until a series of own goals crashed that hope down a slippery slope, and that beautiful Nigerian dream tragically became a nightmare. In 2015, Nigerians were on the march again.
Citizens were so angry with the brand of failure posing as governance that we took a gamble and placed their hopes in today’s ruling party, the APC and President Muhammadu Buhari, a 71-year old former dictator who has now shown neither the capacity nor the aptitude for the highest office in the land. If that campaign was a movie, the title of the movie would be: “The lesser of two evils.”Everything the APC candidate did was justified and excused because he was branded as “the lesser evil.” He was given an easy ride. No serious questions were asked about his competence or track record or world view; he couldn’t even be bothered to attend a presidential debate to defend his ideas in a competitive environment. Yet he was promising CHANGE. And a majority of Nigerian voters bought what he was selling. But where is this change?
I intend to do three things here today:
First, I will lay bare what is at stake in this election by telling you why the failed PDP and its candidate, Atiku Abubakar, are not alternatives to the failed APC and its candidate, President Buhari. They are one and the same, siamese twins of failure and destruction.
Second, I will tell you why my candidacy under the Allied Congress Party of Nigeria (ACPN) represents the most prepared, most qualified and most formidable choice for 2019, and why you cannot afford to sit on the sidelines in this battle for the soul of Nigeria.Finally, I will address the most frequently repeated concerns about my candidacy and then what exactly we need to do to take this movement from here to Aso Rock. So let us look back briefly, to 2015
Do you remember? The chant all across the country was “Anyone But Jonathan.” Sadly, that is how we ended up with this reprobate government.
This time it is: “Anyone But Buhari.” And by that they mean that we should reinstate the failed PDP and its candidate, former vice president Atiku Abubakar because they think Atiku is the only person that can defeat Buhari in 2019. And in 2023, when Atiku and the PDP inevitably fail again, because a bad tree cannot bear good fruit? We will hear new chants of “Anyone But Atiku.”That is how we get looped in a cycle of insanity – repeating the same thing, and expecting a different result. That cycle of failure is unsustainable and it has to end NOW. 2019 cannot be “Anyone But Buhari”. Our country is not a recycling plant for uninspiring old men with their old ideas and old dubious characters. We deserve better than their aggressive mediocrity. And that is why I am running for president – to lead a people’s movement that will permanently terminate bad leadership, retire these incompetents and fight for every Nigerian. For those of you considering the PDP as an alternative, I really want to ask you: what is the thing that you see about them that is any different from the APC. Really? These people are the same: Siamese Twins of Failure.Fellow Nigerians, here is the truth of the matter: the APCPDP is not two parties. The #APCPDP is one single party fielding one single candidate, and that candidate’s name is #BuTiku. Yes, you heard me right – #BuTiku. Buhari and Atiku are conjoined from head to toe as #BuTiku. There is no lesser evil in #BuTiku. #BuTiku are members of the same party. Attempting to choose between these two is like asking one to choose between death by poison or death by gunshot. God forbid. We cannot reject one oppressor and hand over to another oppressor. We do not love bondage. We do not enjoy suffering. God in heaven forbid. I just laugh when I hear some people say our citizens movement will split opposition votes. But the PDP is not in opposition to the APC. The candidate of the PDP has over the past 14 years gone from PDP to AC, AC to PDP, PDP to APC and now back to PDP. These people are brothers and sisters of iniquity and impoverishment, merchants of failure and disappointment. Don’t believe that 419! They are both part of a political ruling class that has held us bound, manipulated and diminished us for decades. Now they are auditioning to extend their streak of failure for another four years? God really forbid! The real opponent that the Nigerian people have in 2019 is this old political order that takes and takes and takes, and never replenishes anything. I should know. I was headhunted from Harvard in 1999, asked to come and help as a technocrat to rebuild a country that had just been recovered from the wasted years of the military. I accepted, like many other brilliant Nigerian minds from home and abroad, and we worked together to bring due process into government, secure debt relief, open up our economy, rebuild institutions and attack poverty. The things I saw with in those days really fired me up to insist on due process, fellow Nigerians. Because for these terrible Nigerian politicians, corruption is all fun and games. These people have no desire but for more power, power, power, power. They stay up at night conspiring to steal and pillage, to loot and destroy. Oh, my brothers and sisters, I served in that government with one of the candidates who is running under #APCPDP in this election. Kai! No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Six and a half years after, in 2007, I had fought the fight that had to be fought from within, and then I left government knowing for sure that if this politicial order is not changed, the work of good governance that good people do within government will never last. I decided not to re-enter government, rebuffing every request made since, and instead made a decision to dedicate my life to activating citizens to push these blood-sucking political class out of office. I returned from the World Bank five years later to do just that, and the PDP was still at it! Same incentives, same behavior. The political class was completely unchanged – and had in fact become completely worse.For goodness sake, what has fundamentally changed about that PDP we have always known? What lessons did the party really learn after its defeat in 2015? Is this not the same PDP that looted the monies meant to equip our military, so that our soldiers had to run away at the sight of Boko Haram, because they had no weapons? The same PDP that spent precious days denying that our Chibok girls were kidnapped and so allowed the terrorists get away? Is this not the same PDP that conducted a recruitment exercise for the Immigration Service that killed scores of our young people and yet nobody was sacked or punished? Haba. How can we forget so easily! So the question is: Apart from forgetfulness, why are some Nigerians suddenly considering the PDP yet again? I have heard some people say it is because the PDP candidate has run successful businesses and therefore will be good for the economy at a time like this.That response just makes me shake my head in wonderment: Is it the same person we know, or are we speaking of another? Perhaps you never read a 2005 email from the president of Atiku’s university which was obtained by US investigators.Let me quote a small portion from that mail: “…The flow of revenue to the university will slow dramatically if Atiku’s political fortunes continue to wane… Construction delays on campus have also raised fears that the prospects for the university are linked to Atiku’s political success.”Did you just hear what that email said? That the success of that man’s private business is dependent on our commonwealth? And there was more!
A special report by a US Senate Committee on Foreign Corruption concluded that “over an eight-year period from 2000 to 2008, Atiku and his wife, Jennifer Douglas were able to bring over $40 million in suspect funds into the United States…”This was at the very time that this person was the Vice President of this very same country. And these are the people you want to put in charge of the national treasury? In charge of the money for your children’s education? Of the resources for our country’s hospitals? Of the budget for our depleted army and our impoverished police force? If we dive into all the filthy issues involving the PDP candidate – from the PTDF saga to the $2.8 million Siemens bribery scandal – we may spend the entire day here today and I simply do not have that time.So let us talk about the present administration, the evil twin.What is the primary legacy of President Muhammadu Buhari? It is the destruction of our nation’s wealth, presiding over the worst economic recession Nigeria has seen in decades. Even now that the economy has come out of recession, the growth is as sluggish as his government. 4 out of every 10 adults today are either unemployed or underemployed, and Nigeria is now the Poverty Capital of the World, the World Bank confirmining that we now have more extremely poor people than India which has a population six times our size.And in the midst of this, his Vice President was celebrating last week at the Nigeria Economic Summit that handing bailouts to state governors to pay salaries is an achievement.
What a big shame!"
"Nigerians will not choose between corruption and incompetence, Oby Ezekwesili insists",https://guardian.ng/news/nigerians-will-not-choose-between-corruption-and-incompetence-oby-ezekwesili-insists/,"Presidential candidate of the Allied Congress Party of Nigeria (ACPN), Oby Ezekwesili, has stated that Nigerians will not choose between incompetence and corruption in next year’s general elections. Describing President Muhammadu Buhari’s administration as incompetent and sluggish, she said former Vice President Abubakar Atiku was corrupt. Ezekwesili, who spoke at a media briefing in Lagos yesterday cautioned that if Nigerians repeat the mistake of 2015 by choosing a lesser evil next year, the country would suffer its consequences. She also said Vice President Yemi Osinbajo’s celebration of bailouts, as an achievement of the present administration is a colossal shame, adding that the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and All Progressives Congress (APC) are like Siamese twins of failure and destruction. “In 2015, the chant all across the country was ‘Anyone But Jonathan.’ Sadly, that is how we ended up with this reprobate government. This time it is: ‘Anyone But Buhari.’ “And by that they mean that we should reinstate the failed PDP and its candidate, because they think he is the only person that can defeat Buhari in 2019 and in 2023 when Atiku and PDP fail again, because a bad tree cannot bear good fruits.”"
"Buhari lacks aptitude to lead Nigeria, says Ezekwesili",https://guardian.ng/news/buhari-lacks-aptitude-to-lead-nigeria-says-ezekwesili/,"The presidential candidate of the Allied Congress Party of Nigeria (ACPN),Oby Ezekwesili said President Muhammadu Buhari lacks the aptitude and capacity to continue to lead Africa’s most populous country. “President Muhammadu Buhari has now shown neither the capacity nor the aptitude for the highest office in the land,” Ezekwesili said on Monday at a press conference in Lagos as her party unveiled its road-map for winning the 2019 presidential elections. “Let us talk about the present administration; what is the primary legacy of President Muhammadu Buhari? It is the destruction of our nation’s wealth — presiding over the worse economic recession Nigeria has seen in decades. “Even now that the economy has come out of recession, the growth is as sluggish as its government. Four out of every 10 adults are either unemployed or underemployed and Nigeria is now the poverty capital of the world,” she added. The APCN presidential candidate accused Buhari of being the “most nepotistic and most partisan president that Nigeria has ever seen” and said that the president who rode on the promises to fight corruption in 2015 is also “corrupt”  “This president talks about fighting grand corruption. Please, please, give me a break! Can corruption fight corruption? Does he think we cannot see?” Ezekwesili said The Presidential hopeful, who was the minister of education under the People’s Democratic party-led administration, said the opposition party is not also a better alternative to move Nigeria forward. “I just laugh when I hear some people say our citizen’s movement will split opposition votes. But the PDP is not in opposition to the APC. The candidate of the PDP has over the past 14 years gone from PDP to AC, AC to PDP, PDP to APC and now back to PDP” Ezekwesili said Ezekwesili also took a swipe at Buhari and PDP’s presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar, noting that if she eventually becomes the Nigerian president, “you will never hear any world leader call me lifeless or dishonest.” “I have no issues obtaining visas or travelling to any country in the world – whether it is the United States of America or the United Arab Emirates,” she said in a not-so-veiled reference to the PDP presidential candidate.  Recently, Financial Times reported that the United States president Donald Trump referred to Buhari as “lifeless” shortly after a meeting between the two leaders in April. The PDP presidential candidate, on his part, is rumoured to be avoiding travelling to the United States because of a pending indictment. The former minister of education, while stating her achievement in office, said she “introduced Public Private Partnership models for education service delivery and very importantly ensured that Innovation & Vocational Enterprise Institutions were accredited, certified and regulated by the National Board for Technical Education.” Ezekwesili, therefore, affirmed that the ruling party and opposition party are “brothers and sisters of iniquity and impoverishment, merchants of failure and disappointment.”"
"‘Politics is the art of the impossible, made possible’",https://guardian.ng/guardian-woman/politics-is-the-art-of-the-impossible-made-possible/,"Otto Von Bismarck once said, “Politics is the art of the possible, the attainable – the art of the next best.” Some qualify that it is also the art of the impossible. Indeed, anything is possible, as seen by the huge shake-up in African Gender Politics this month, most recently this week with Ethiopia electing its first female President, not to mention Prime Minister Aby Ahmed appointing new female ministers and enabling the country to be the first African country with 50 per cent female ministers. Then earlier there was the unprecedented candidacy announcement of Oby Ezekwesili, who’s campaigning as “the anti-establishment candidate,” and labelled by the ACPN as the “hope” candidate, in a similar fashion to Obama, back in 2008. Sadly, Nigeria is ranked far lower than nations such as South Africa, Rwanda, Uganda, Zambia and Mauritania and most recently Ethiopia among countries that encourage women to engage in politics. Rwanda with its parliament being top in the world in female representation at over 60 per cent deliberately increased women in decision-making roles and the country is progressing well economically, despite its recent dark and genocidal past. Perhaps the presence of women will in itself prevent the country from ever repeating its atrocious history. Where African politics is concerned, we are often looking at impossible situations that need to be changed, and in many parts of Nigeria, that’s the case. But how can we expect change, without getting down to the crux of these matters? Meaning, community level politics, where locals can get together and discuss and decide what their needs are. There is too much power politics in Nigeria; it’s more about power rather than policy change up top. We need the balance of a bottom-up approach, and this is where we need women to get more involved. Mothers, the people concerned about the wellbeing of their families, having access to healthcare, getting their kids to school… Women’s approach to politics is usually less about power and more about trying to solve social problems. Of course there are exceptions to this rule but women tend to try to solve community level issues, and not just women’s issues. Some may doubt the electoral power of Ms Ezekwesili, but she’s well-known for leading the #BringBackOurGirls campaign, a former education minister and a former Vice President of the World Bank’s Africa division and she’s setting a great example. When it comes to politics, women generally want to get involved in social matters worldwide and there are more female celebrities becoming ambassadors to international organisations and travelling down to communities to “mother” them, be it for a short and temporary while. Because this is what women are good at. So, wake up, ladies of Nigeria. If you don’t get involved, nothing is going to change. Politics is the art of the impossible, made possible. Let’s turn our impossible situations into possible solutions. Nigeria, we have a lot of catching up to do. We women also have to help ourselves. I believe Nigeria will accept more women bringing more to the table, but we have to engage ourselves. The men are not going to force us to do so. Former president Olusegun Obasanjo has hailed female politicians as being more “trustworthy” and recently pointed out that “no nation will become great when half of her population ends up only in the kitchen and ‘the other room’, or get disproportionately discriminated against in the higher echelons of corporate management and in governance.”

Human rights and post-2019 presidency,https://guardian.ng/opinion/human-rights-and-post-2019-presidency/,"At the weekend, I got into a very lengthy conversation with my younger brother currently based abroad and who left Nigeria when his life became endangered by open threats made by some Islamists responsible for the spate of violent attacks targeting largely Christian communities in the North of Nigeria. Our conversations centred around the deteriorated security situations not just in Nigeria but in a lot of regional neighbouring communities making up the West African nations otherwise known as Economic Community of West African States.  There is also no doubt that Nigeria is the epicenter of the expanding frontiers of Islamic terrorism. But what really triggered this mutual but frank dialogue was the emergence on Sunday noon of the erstwhile vice president Alhaji Abubakar Atiku as the official standard bearer of the largest opposition political party in the sub-Saharan African region – the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Other notable Nigerians who are flying the presidential flags of some of the newly registered political parties include the former Vice President of the World’s Bank and erstwhile Education minister, Mrs. Oby Ezekwesili; former Deputy Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria and a Professor of Economics in a U.S. based university, Dr. Kingsley Moghalu and the former governor of Cross Rivets State, Mr. Donald Duke.  Emeka, my very brilliant younger sibling is a philosopher by academic qualification and an illustrious human rights practitioner.  He is one of the intellectuals backing and participating actively and constructively in the agitations for self-determination in Nigeria of the Igbo nationality as coordinated by a completely peace loving and unarmed group of human rights activists – Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB). In addition to threats of death from government agents involved in the enforced disappearances of reputable opponents of the political status quo in Nigeria, Nigeria has become polarized alongside ethno religious fault lines.  This highly cerebral philosopher brother of mine was basically concerned about the re-emergence as president for a second tenure of one of Nigeria’s most divisive and bigoted political leaders – the retired Army General Muhammadu Buhari in the year 2019 general elections. Put differently, Emeka asked to know the post-2019 human right agenda of the President who would emerge if a transparent election is conducted. His question is how the Nigerian people can basically safeguard the sanctity of the forthcoming election given the notoriety displayed by the central electoral governing and management council known in law as the Independent National Electoral Commission. His anxiety about the lack of credibility of the current head of the independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) is also shared by millions of Nigerians who watched with considerable trepidation as the electoral umpire rigged the recently held Osun State governorship poll. Two United States senators, Chris Coons (D-Del.) and Cory Booker (D-N.J.), both members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, have raised concerns about the credibility of elections in Nigeria following allegations of political interference in the latest governorship polls. Coons and Booker said in a joint statement that though the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) had been commended by observers for its conduct of the recent polls, concerns remained about the prospects of free and fair elections in the country. The statement read, “As members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, we are troubled by reports of incidents of political interference and intimidation of voters, journalists, and civil society observers in Nigeria by some security agencies and political party supporters. Nigeria is Africa’s largest economy and a key U.S. partner on the continent. “While domestic and international election observers have credited electoral authorities for their administration of elections thus far, we are concerned about the prospects for a free, fair and credible democratic process in Nigeria in light of recent interference by government security forces on peaceful assembly and freedom of expression, as well as ongoing security threats and communal tensions in several regions of the country. “General elections in February 2019 will be an important step for Nigeria to consolidate democratic gains achieved in the last two decades since the transition from military to civilian democratic rule. We are watching the parties’ primaries with interest, and we call on party leaders, electoral authorities, security officials, and all Nigerians to respect the political process and safeguard free, fair, credible, and peaceful elections that reflect the will of the people.” Recall that governorship elections were held on September 22 in Osun State and won by the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) after initially being declared inconclusive by INEC after PDP led. After the voting on September 22, the candidate of the main opposition party, Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Senator Ademola Adeleke, had won the majority of votes. He was followed by the APC candidate, Gboyega Oyetola. But INEC declared the election inconclusive and conducted a rerun on September 27. After adding up the votes, Oyetola was declared winner by INEC. The failure to declare PDP the winner is extra constitutional because the constitution says simple majority is the deciding factor for electoral victory in that category. INEC had also awarded the APC victory in an earlier controversial governorship poll in Ekiti State on July14. In both elections, PDP and other opposition elements alleged foul play and interference by the ruling APC. The worries expressed by these two United States’ parliamentarians cuts across the feelings of millions of Nigerians who have similar sentiments that there is no assurance that the electoral panel will be transparent and ready to conduct a free, fair, peaceful and transparent general elections come 2019. As observed by these Americans, the interferences into the election come majorly from the security forces. The apprehensions that the current heads of the internal security team will compromise the election finds supports in the fact that almost all the current heads of the different armed security institutions owed their unmerited retention to the current president who is desperate for a second tenure. There is therefore the imperative demand that the fuller intents of Section 158 (1) of the constitution is respected which means that whatever measures that are needed to be enforced to guarantee independence of the electoral commission should be put in place. Whereas the fundamental concern of my younger brother was on who is best suited to restore national stability and the security of lives and property of Nigerians, it is as clear as the early morning sunrise that the Buhari–led administration has failed in the discharge of the primary duty of government. The primary duty of government as enshrined in Section 14 (2) (b) of the constitution is as follows: “The security and welfare of the people shall be the primary purpose of government.” It is a fact that hundreds-of-thousands of Nigerians have left the shores of Nigerian since the emergence of the current government just as those who had earlier left due to security threats have found concrete, genuine, verifiable reasons to remain where they are or risks their lives by returning at this material time. In Benue State alone, more than 1,500 persons have been killed in the last three years due to the bloody insurgency of armed Fulani herdsmen who enjoy the protection of the current administration. Plateau state has been in turmoil due largely to the violent insurgency of armed Fulani herdsmen. Southern Kaduna and Nasarawa neighbouring Abuja has had their shares of these murderous and targeted killings of Christians.  Both in words and action, key functionaries of the current government have clearly backed the activities of the armed Fulani gangsters.  The minister of Defence was quoted as blaming the anti-open grazing laws in Benue State for the bloody attacks by Fulani herdsmen. Dan-Ali the Fulani born minister of Defence had told state house reporters that the blockage of cattle routes across the country is the remote cause of the killings by herdsmen. “Whatever crisis that happens at anytime, there are remote and immediate causes. Look at this issue (killings in Benue and Taraba) what is the remote cause of the farmers’ crisis? Since the nation’s independence, we know there used to be a route whereby the cattle rearers take because they are all over the nation. If you go to Bayelsa or Ogun, you will see them. If those routes are blocked, what do you expect will happen? These people are Nigerians. It is just like one going to block the shoreline; does that make sense to you? But the immediate cause is the grazing law.” Mansur Dan-Ali, in the aforementioned thoughtless statement has demonstrated the callous insensitivity of the Buhari’s administration to the violence unleashed on Nigerians by armed Fulani herdsmen.  This also shows why the major organisation backing the Fulani herdsmen known as Miyetti Allah Cattle Owners Association, has yet to be declared a terrorist group even when they back the killings.
To be continued on tomorrow.

Oby Ezekwesili: Nobility In Service,https://guardian.ng/life/oby-ezekwesili-nobility-in-service/," Obiageli Ezekwesili was born in 1963. Ezekwesili holds a master’s degree in International Law and Diplomacy from the University of Lagos, and a Master of Public Administration degree from the Kennedy School of Government, Harvard University.  Before she obeyed the national clarion call, she worked as a chartered accountant in Deloitte and Touche and at the Center for International Development, Harvard. Her stint with the government began with her appointment as the first head of the Budget Monitoring and Price Intelligence Unit (popularly known as Due Process Unit). During her time, she was credited with changing and cleansing the method of public procurement or contracting at the Federal level in Nigeria.
In June 2005, she was appointed the Minister of Solid Minerals (Mines and Steel) and again, she kicked off a reform programme that put Nigeria on the global platform as a mining investment destination.  A year later, she became the Federal Minister of Education and in March 2007, she was appointed her Vice president of World Bank Africa region.
The co-founder of Transparency International (TI) has been named in BBC’s 100 Women, Time 100 Most Influential People, New York Times 25 Women of Impact for 2015, Albert Einstein’s Foundation’s Genius:100 Visions of the Future. In 2014, she became a co-convener of the #BringBackOurGirls campaign, the campaign addressed the kidnap of the 300 Chibok girls which received global recognition.
Owing to her achievements and her “fight against corruption”, she was nominated a recipient of the 2018 Nobel Peace Prize. The Peace Research Institute Oslo (PRIO) director Henrik Urdal described as her “an international champion in the fight against corruption… Chairperson of the Nigeria Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (NEITI), leading the first-ever national implementation of the global EITI standards.”"
Ezekwesili picks Gani Galadima as running mate,https://guardian.ng/news/ezekwesili-picks-gani-galadima-as-running-mate/,"The presidential candidate of the Allied Congress Party of Nigeria (ACPN), Oby Ezekwesili, has picked Abdulganiy Galadima as her running mate for the 2019 presidential election. This was disclosed on Wednesday in Ilorin when the presidential hopeful unveiled her full manifesto themed #ProjectRescueNigeria Galadinma, while reacting to the announcement thanked Ezekweili for her confidence for giving him a very tasking mission to be embarked upon. “As your vice presidential candidate, I want to tell you, your excellency, that I will work with you,” Galadinma said. “I will work with you to go deep down to the grassroots, to move to the length and breadth of the country trying to see to the Nigerian people,” he added."
Oby Ezekwesili: For The Love Of Nigeria,https://guardian.ng/life/oby-ezekwesili-for-the-love-of-nigeria/," Oby Ezekwesili is in the race to dislodge faltering Nigeria’s President Muhammadu Buhari. But a year ago, upending the political status quo in Africa’s most populous nation was, perhaps, only a residual thought; not something she would have loved. Twice a minister, first for education and later solid minerals under President Olusegun Obasanjo, Ezekwesili is not alien to the workings of the government. Her effort to make government procurement processes accountable and transparent as the pioneer head of the Budget Monitoring and Price Intelligence Unit earned her the nickname Madam Due Process. Her penchant for wanting things done the right way was recently acknowledged by a former president of Malawi Dr Joyce Banda. Banda describes how Ezekwesili’s counsel helped her in fighting corruption in her country. “While fighting corruption during my Presidency in 2013, @obyezeks advised me to protect myself with a forensic audit, which UK gov supported. I am forever grateful for this transparent, accountable daughter of Africa, a servant leader pushing for a better Nigeria,” Banda tweeted on November 20. Oby Ezekwesili For someone who was once a minister, an appointment, which is usually a product of political affiliation and patronage, her hatred for politics can be blamed on the rot in Nigeria’s political system. “I never had interest in politics. Anyone who knows me knows that I detest politics,” she says. “But I had to get to the place where listening to the political class say to us that we have to choose the lesser of two evils got me infuriated.” One important driving force behind her decision to cast aside her hatred for politics is the way the human lives have been cheapened since the advent of President Muhammadu Buhari’s administration. Buhari defeated the then incumbent Goodluck Jonathan in Nigeria’s general elections after campaigning to fight corruption, reposition the economy and strengthen internal security, especially in the Northeast. Ezekwesili agrees that Buhari can be given a “little bit of score” for what he has done in the strife-torn region, but insists that a government that allowed Nigeria’s economy to tank on the “back of oil shock” and wrong policy choices should not be allowed to lead the country beyond May 29, 2019. Beyond the downward spiral of the economy which has seen the unemployment rate rise to 18.80 in Q3 2017 when the last job figures were released, Ezekwesili is miffed by the spate of violence across the country and a biased anti-graft war. “This is a Nigeria under President Muhammadu Buhari where the primacy of the human life has been completely devalued…life is cheapened,” she says. “The lives of Nigerians today are not any better because President Buhari became our president. As a matter of fact, the quality of lives has taken a significant beaten.” Her misgiving about Buhari’s handling of the economy preceded her dream of being the president of Nigeria. In 2016, she lampooned the government’s “command and control” economic policies while faulting the intention of the President Buhari to protect the poor. “The president comes into this economic philosophy on the premise that he does not want the poor to suffer. I can relate to that, a leader must not allow the poor to suffer, especially a leader who knows that most of his votes came not from the elite but from the poor,” she said at The Platform, a public policy forum, in April 2016. “The problem though is that the intention and the outcome are diverged.” Obviously, her patience to continue to “relate” to such “archaic” policies ran out. Oby Ezekwesili While Ezekwesili has her mind firmly set on dethroning Buhari when the country goes to poll in the first quarter of 2019, she has to contend with a political culture that is both anti-woman and excessively moneyed. The odds are staggering. But she insists that the “fight” for “a new independence from our rapacious ruling class” is winnable. She is very much convinced that she represents millions of Nigerians who are disenchanted by years of failure of the current and past administrations. “I am not running alone,” she says with a definite conviction. “We are all running. This contest is between the political class that has failed over and over against the Nigerian people and the Nigerian people.” But in a country where the voting public is easily ingratiated by quick and fleeting political favours and an entrenched political culture that has done little to curb electoral malpractices, how she will able to best her opponents is yet to be seen. It is impossible that Ezekwesili is unaware of these odds. Yet, she brims with the hope that her dream of repositioning Nigeria for a greater good will be realised. “I am the candidate of the people,” she remarks. Oby Ezekwesili Ezekwesili is not exactly new to facing down challenges. Her activism preceded the kidnapping of the Chibok girls in 2014. She was a member and the first female leader of The Concerned Professionals Citizens Movement. The group campaigned for Nigeria’s return to democracy in the 1990s. In recent years, she has been one of the most consistent voices against misrule and the excesses of the Nigerian political class. When the Chibok Girls were kidnapped from their schools in April 2014, she became a vocal advocate for their quick rescue. #BringBackOurGirls, a movement which she co-founded adopted a number of approaches -including sits-out and marches – to pressure the then President Goodluck Jonathan to act fast rescuing of the girls. Loyalists of the sitting Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) government accused her of being a paid agent. That led into her passport being briefly seized by the agents of the state when she was travelling to London in July 2014. When power changed hands in May 2015, Nigerians hoped the new government would introduce a new system of doing things. And for Ezekwesili, her travails in the hands of the government took a drastic turn. In January, she and seven other members of the BBOG movement were arrested and detained by police while protesting for the release for the Chibok Girls. In June, her one-man march on the Nigerian State House, Abuja to protest the killings of 100 persons by suspected herdsmen in Plateau communities in June was halted by security operatives. Again, she has been at the receiving end of attacks from loyalists of the current All Progressives Congress (APC), who felt her criticism of the Buhari administration was one too many, and from agents of the PDP, who thought she was beyond being forgiven for allegedly contributing to the party’s losses at the polls in 2015. But Ezekwesili insists her advocacy for the girl child and the woman will not take a back seat in spite of her personal dream of rescuing Nigeria from the grips APC and PDP. “Chibok girls, Leah Sharibu…will permanently remain the basis of my advocacy,” she tells Guardian Life. “The advocacy that we have done concerning Chibok girls and Leah Sharibu is one that is endless. It is never going to come to an end until those girls are back.” And there is always family and friends
Left to her husband, Chinedu Ezekwesili, she would have been into active politics much earlier. He has first-hand experience about how passionate she is about solving Nigeria’s problems. And when she eventually told him that she was going to contest the presidency, there was a eureka moment. “‘Finally, my baby is ready,’ he told me when I told him,” she says. Her three sons, on the other hand, were a bit worried. But they all gave their support to her aspirations. “Our children…they know how totally committed to Nigeria I am. Even though they worry, but on the aggregate, the whole idea is, ‘Mum, go ahead and do this.’” Ezekwesili firmly believes in a family creating a culture that works for its members, without anyone being unduly disadvantaged. “Every family where people act together don’t have to debate who does what,” she says. For anyone to be a functional member of a society, she says, possession of “all the [necessary] skills is important."
Oby Ezekwesili: Running Against Corruption,https://guardian.ng/life/oby-ezekwesili-running-against-corruption/," Since her entry into active politics, Oby Ezekwesili has become one of Nigeria’s mouthpiece. Unlike the characteristic nature of Nigerian public office holders of going into oblivion after serving, Ezekwesili has remained undaunted in ensuring that Nigeria is the country she dreams of. From her times as Madam Due Process because of her radical and transparent approach to eradicating all forms of damaging practices in the government procurement process to giving counsels that is used in different countries administrations to tackle corruption, there is no doubt that the former vice president of the World Bank for Africa is ready for the role as the country’s first position. With her campaign running, she says she never had an interest in politics…”But I had to get to the place where listening to the political class say to us that we have to choose the lesser of two evils got me infuriated,” she told Guardian Life. Speaking on the Bring Back Our Girls Campaign, a committed cause she is known for, she tells Guardian Life her experience including her one-man march. “This is a Nigeria under President Muhammadu Buhari where the primacy of the human life has been completely devalued…life is cheapened,” she says. Ezekwesili is also miffed by the spate of violence across the country and a biased anti-graft war.
She is very much convinced that she represents millions of Nigerians who are disenchanted by years of failure of the current and past administrations.

"Buhari’s anti-graft war unspectacular, says Ezekwesili",https://guardian.ng/news/buharis-anti-graft-war-unspectacular-says-ezekwesili/,"Presidential aspirant, Oby Ezekwesili, on Wednesday, said that President Muhammadu Buhari has not done any spectacular work in his fight against corruption. While he was campaigning for presidency in 2015, Buhari’s manifesto was hinged on rebuilding the economy, a  strong anti-corruption war and a fight against insurgency. Buhari won at the presidential polls ahead of the then incumbent President Goodluck Jonathan, whose tenure had been riddled with allegations of grand scale corruption affecting even the fight against insurgents. However, three years into his tenure and months before the next general elections, the President, seeking re-election, has been accused of fighting a selective anti-corruption war. The Allied Congress for Progressives Change candidate said the anti-graft agencies including the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) are being used by the president to pick on members of opposition parties. “On corruption, President Buhari has not done any spectacular work,” Ezekwesili told Guardian TV. “What he has done is reduce the fight against corruption to a tunnel vision of EFCC hunting down those who have not joined the APC,” Ezekwesili said. “We are saying that fighting corruption is a comprehensive approach that looks at reducing opportunities of corruption through the kind of structural changes and systemic changes and policies that change the way that governments acts in an economy. “President Buhari has lived below the expectation of the integrity that he told us was his significant point or selling point on the basis of which Nigerians elected him.” Ezekwesili, who plans to unseat Buhari at the 2019 polls, insisted that Nigerians do not have to choose between two evils or choose the lesser evil. “Nigeria needs to be rescued from the entrenched system of politics that is a cyclical pattern of failure. We cannot be choosing any evil. We don’t need evil to fix the conditions that we have found ourselves. We need the right sets of thoughts in development. We need people with character, competence and capacity, who lead not for themselves but for the society,” she said. “I want to be that person that challenges this very artificial construct that Nigeria cannot amount to any good. We can fight and get Nigeria to that place of promise that it belongs.” The Bring Back our Girls convener noted that while there have been gains in the war against insurgency in the North east of Nigeria, the government still hasn’t taken Nigerians to the promised land. “The North east that was mostly occupied by the terrorist is not occupied to that extent. But people have not been able to all return to their neighbourhoods and communities. Lives have not been restored, we still have millions of our people in IDP camps,” Ezekwesili said. “This is the Nigeria under the President Muhammadu Buhari where the primacy of the human life has completely been devalued. Life is cheapened.” She also lamented the poor economic policies of the current government that has led the nation to be named the poverty capital by the World Poverty Clock. “The economy that was on an average growth of 5-6% was allowed to tank on the back of oil shock, but mostly because of very very wrong policy choices. the economic policy choices of the administration has put the economy in dire straits and that is something that we must fight. “The lives of Nigerians are not today any better because President Buhari became our president. The primacy of the human life has taken a significant beating.”"
Personal attacks as nature of presidential campaigns to come,https://guardian.ng/politics/personal-attacks-as-nature-of-presidential-campaigns-to-come/,"As the 2019 presidential election draws nearer, there are indications that the campaign would be characterised by personal attacks and brickbat. Already, opponents of President Mohammadu Buhari are pointing at loopholes in virtually all policies of his All Progressives Congress (APC) government. But what seems to be lacking is clear identification of the lapses and solutions to them. Prominent among the critics in recent time is the candidate of the Allied Congress Party of Nigeria (ACPN), Dr. Oby Ezekwesili. The one-time vice president of World Bank has on every available platform condemned the candidates of both Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and All Progressives Congress (APC), describing them as incompetent and corrupt. She maintained that the emergence of both Atiku Abubakar (PDP) and Mohammadu Buhari (APC) would amount to recycling of ‘political fraudsters’, which has slowed down the economic growth of the country. However, many Nigerians, think that the battle for Aso-Rock Villa is between the two vilified candidates (Buhari and Atiku), given their wide range of experience, political sagacity, structure and financial stamina to woo voters. Ezekwesili thinks otherwise, insisting that such opinion is only for the ignorant, and ought to fade off in the polity. According to her, the thought that some people are in control of some parts of the country, and so, will influence the election, is totally false. Citing example, she noted that the National Leader of APC, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu’s political strength is grossly overrated. Specifically, she noted that Tinubu, who most people think controls Lagos State, does not have control of Alimosho, the largest council area in the state, adding the he was only able to deliver 86,897 votes out of the 650,000 registered voters in Alimosho in the last presidential election. “Tinubu is believed to wield much power in the South-West. He worked for the election of President Muhammadu Buhari in 2015. Tinubu and his like in #APCPDP control only as much as we let them. Alimosho, for example, is the largest council area in Lagos State, with over 1.2 million residents, according to official census figures. In 2015, only about 650,000 of these people registered and obtained their Permanent Voters Cards (PVCs).” She added that it was because the people were faced with the unattractive choice of voting for PDP’s Goodluck Jonathan, or the anyone-but-Jonathan candidacy represented by Muhammadu Buhari, a great many voters chose to abstain from 2015 election. “At the end of the day, they only managed to conjure up 140,000 votes between them, in almighty Alimosho. This says something loud and clear that Tinubu, with all of his ‘might’ and experience in so-called grassroots politics, could, at the end of the day, deliver only 86,897 votes for his candidate Buhari and their party. Where then does the source of this his widely reported power come from? Isn’t he grossly overestimated?” ‘Butiku’
Ezekwesili, in skepticism, described the two parties as Siamese Twins that could not be separated by any doctor. She maintained that for those who have been saying that the 2019 election is anyone but Buhari would be surprised as they would be forced to sing the same song of anyone but Atiku in 2023. She maintained that both parties are not two but a single party fielding one single candidate, “and that candidate’s name is BuTiku. Yes, you heard me right, BuTiku.” She noted that any attempt to choose between the two is like asking somebody to choose between death by poison or death by gunshot. “God forbid. We cannot reject one oppressor and hand over to another. We do not love bondage. We do not enjoy suffering. God in heaven forbid. “I just laugh when I hear some people say our citizens movement will split opposition votes. But the PDP is not in opposition to the APC. The candidate of the PDP has over the past 14 years gone from PDP to AC, AC to PDP, PDP to APC and now back to PDP. These people are brothers and sisters of iniquity and impoverishment, merchants of failure and disappointment. Don’t believe that 419! They are both part of a political ruling class that has held us bound, manipulated and diminished us for decades. “Now they are auditioning to extend their streak of failure for another four years? God really forbid! The real opponent that the Nigerian people have in 2019 is this old political order that takes and takes and takes, and never replenishes anything.” ‘Obytiku’s visit’
Following Ezekwesili’s meeting with one of Nigeria’s former military rulers, Ibrahim Babangida, at his residence in Minna, Niger State, a lot of criticisms from Nigerians have assailed that visit, prominent among the critic is the presidential candidate of African Action Congress (AAC), Omoyele Sowore. Recall that Ezekwesili has been a critique of all previous governments in the country but on Monday, Ezekwesili tweeted that she met with Babangida to discuss how Nigeria must be taken out of the clutches of the old order in 2019. “I had a very candid conversation with former head of state, Ibrahim Babangida, in Minna after my speech on Human Capital Development at El Amin School. I made it clear that Nigeria must be taken out of the clutches of the Old Order. This is our mission,” she tweeted. Reacting to this, Sowore maintained that her meeting with the former military ruler should not have held. “Our dear Ezekwesili wants to stop corruption and mis-governance in Nigeria but then holds a secret session with the Godfather of corruption and bad governance, IBB. Nigerians, Ezekwesili creatively coined BUTIKU. I love it! But this single visit is OBYTIKU.” Ezekwesili warned against derogatory campaign
However, a group of Atiku’s supporters, under the aegis of Atiku for Better Nigeria, has warned Ezekwesili to desist from using derogatory remarks against Atiku and the Peoples Democratic Party, advising her to concentrate on her campaign and stop tagging other contestants and political parties as fraudsters. The group, in a statement by its National Coordinator, Benita Dike-Israel, advised Ezekwesili to learn the ropes in politics so as to avoid “falling into the abyss”. They argued that by painting Atiku and the PDP black, Ezekwesili was indicting herself and biting the fingers that fed her since she was a minister under the PDP regime. “Ezekwesili should learn not to be rude to Atiku or bite the fingers that fed her. For her to say that the PDP and Atiku lack knowledge in economy and (are) into 419 politics is self-indicting. That means her period, as Minister of Education and Solid Minerals added no value to the party that appointed her and to Nigeria as a whole; that also means that her immense credential amounts to naught and (she) has nothing new to offer. After all, a river is as good as its source; for whatever is built on void is void.” The Atiku supporters argued that by joining politics, Ezekwesili, who had been spearheading the campaign for the release of the abducted Chibok schoolgirls through the #BringBackOurGirls movement, had “diluted her fame and goodwill among ordinary Nigerians and friends of Nigeria.” According to the group, people will now begin to see Ezekwesili’s campaign for the release of the Chibok schoolgirls as “a mere ruse, smokescreen and cheap opportunity to feather her own political nest. Whereas it is her constitutional right as an eligible Nigerian to contest the election, yet she should understand politics as a game of persuasion and lobbying rather than (using) pressure group tactics of brick batting and (using) foul language. She can politicise without being rude and judgmental.”

Revisiting the Air Nigeria project,https://guardian.ng/opinion/revisiting-the-air-nigeria-project/,"Sir: When on July 18, 2018 Hadi Sirika, the Minister of State for Aviation, told a large audience, including aviation experts during a diplomatic trip to the United Kingdom of Nigeria preparedness to float Nigeria Air, many were ecstatic about the project. He said, the project was aimed at resurrecting the defunct Nigeria Airways. The project was said to bring about innovation in the Aviation sector of the country. It therefore, came as a quaking bombshell, when it was announced that the proposed project has been put on hold. One continues to wonder if the motive behind the project was well thought-out and planned, as the sudden suspension clearly portrays a wrong approach and perhaps wasteful decision.  Or how do you explain that a project supposedly well planned and driven actively was put on hold due to alleged investors’ apathy? It would be recalled that on July 18, 2018 at the Farnborough international Airshow in the UK, the Nigerian minister of state for aviation announced that the erstwhile Nigeria Airways will be making a return to the skies as Nigeria Air. The minister said the Nigerian government will inject 8.8 million dollars into Nigeria Air as viability gap funding. He said the private sector investors will bring some 300 million dollars as start-up capital.  Obviously, it was shocking when the public got to know that Nigerian Air may not fly for now. Perhaps the project would have continued if only communication was efficient or if knowledgeable Nigerians had been involved rather than the snippets dropped here and there by those in charge. Even the views of the Nigerian air operators were waved off as the experts foresaw loopholes in floating a National airline from scratch, when there were still many deficits on the act. One of the notable Nigerians who spoke against the investment was Oby Ezekwesili, the former minister of Education, who faulted the plan and financial implication of Nigerian Air. The decay of Nigeria Airways commenced in 2003, when planes became flying coffins due to substandard purchase of Aircraft. The Aviation industry has witnessed several losses of lives and property worth billions. Transportation by air became a risk to the masses, everything that could go wrong with the aviation sector did go wrong from the disengagement and payoff of the former staff still pending to the aborted or better still pending project of Nigeria Air. The project will continually be hollow and a mere drain pipe on the public fund at the expense of the Nigerian tax payer as long as the problem in the Air sector is not checked. Having a newly birthed Nigeria Air is a good and welcome development. However, it would have to go beyond Sirika’s optimism and nice words to become an achievable dream.  There must be a renewed commitment from the government and private sector players to see Nigeria Air work out, as Nigeria is a sleeping giant that has been stirred from sleep. The aviation sector is one of the sectors in the country’s economy that can shake up this giant to consciousness if well harnessed and utilised. Therefore, investors with sincere motives should be bought into plan. Also, there should be an agreed plan of such intended and magnificent project just as the place of private public partnership remains valid for this kind of idea. Furthermore, Air Nigeria should go beyond some set of political individuals. We have experts who are Nigerians and will be willing to be part of the think-thank on the initiative and this should be explored totally. Nevertheless, there should be political will to have Air Nigeria rather than vote appeal intention. A laudable project such as Air Nigeria is strategic to the economic growth of the nation and aviation sector. Government should endeavour to resuscitate it. It must not be allowed to die.

"Buhari’s government is corrupt, says Ezekwesili",https://guardian.ng/politics/buharis-government-is-corrupt-says-ezekwesili/,"A speech by Obiageli  ‘Oby’ Ezekwesili, presidential candidate of the Allied Congress Party of Nigeria at a World Press Conference on Monday, October 29, 2018 in Lagos. How can they say that we are finished?
We have just begun.
We have nowhere else to run to.
We have nowhere else to go. Ladies and gentlemen, you are welcome to this conference. When the singer TY Bello released that powerful anthem in 2011, Nigerians were on the march to a historic election. It was an election that showed us a vision of what is possible in our country – that the son of a humble fisherman from a minority tribe in the Niger Delta can rise to become president of the federal republic of Nigeria.The winner of that presidential election described his victory as “the renewal of hope” in Nigeria. And most Nigerians believed him.Until a series of own goals crashed that hope down a slippery slope, and that beautiful Nigerian dream tragically became a nightmare. In 2015, Nigerians were on the march again.
Citizens were so angry with the brand of failure posing as governance that we took a gamble and placed their hopes in today’s ruling party, the APC and President Muhammadu Buhari, a 71-year old former dictator who has now shown neither the capacity nor the aptitude for the highest office in the land. If that campaign was a movie, the title of the movie would be: “The lesser of two evils.”Everything the APC candidate did was justified and excused because he was branded as “the lesser evil.” He was given an easy ride. No serious questions were asked about his competence or track record or world view; he couldn’t even be bothered to attend a presidential debate to defend his ideas in a competitive environment. Yet he was promising CHANGE. And a majority of Nigerian voters bought what he was selling. But where is this change?
I intend to do three things here today:
First, I will lay bare what is at stake in this election by telling you why the failed PDP and its candidate, Atiku Abubakar, are not alternatives to the failed APC and its candidate, President Buhari. They are one and the same, siamese twins of failure and destruction.
Second, I will tell you why my candidacy under the Allied Congress Party of Nigeria (ACPN) represents the most prepared, most qualified and most formidable choice for 2019, and why you cannot afford to sit on the sidelines in this battle for the soul of Nigeria.Finally, I will address the most frequently repeated concerns about my candidacy and then what exactly we need to do to take this movement from here to Aso Rock. So let us look back briefly, to 2015
Do you remember? The chant all across the country was “Anyone But Jonathan.” Sadly, that is how we ended up with this reprobate government.
This time it is: “Anyone But Buhari.” And by that they mean that we should reinstate the failed PDP and its candidate, former vice president Atiku Abubakar because they think Atiku is the only person that can defeat Buhari in 2019. And in 2023, when Atiku and the PDP inevitably fail again, because a bad tree cannot bear good fruit? We will hear new chants of “Anyone But Atiku.”That is how we get looped in a cycle of insanity – repeating the same thing, and expecting a different result. That cycle of failure is unsustainable and it has to end NOW. 2019 cannot be “Anyone But Buhari”. Our country is not a recycling plant for uninspiring old men with their old ideas and old dubious characters. We deserve better than their aggressive mediocrity. And that is why I am running for president – to lead a people’s movement that will permanently terminate bad leadership, retire these incompetents and fight for every Nigerian. For those of you considering the PDP as an alternative, I really want to ask you: what is the thing that you see about them that is any different from the APC. Really? These people are the same: Siamese Twins of Failure.Fellow Nigerians, here is the truth of the matter: the APCPDP is not two parties. The #APCPDP is one single party fielding one single candidate, and that candidate’s name is #BuTiku. Yes, you heard me right – #BuTiku. Buhari and Atiku are conjoined from head to toe as #BuTiku. There is no lesser evil in #BuTiku. #BuTiku are members of the same party. Attempting to choose between these two is like asking one to choose between death by poison or death by gunshot. God forbid. We cannot reject one oppressor and hand over to another oppressor. We do not love bondage. We do not enjoy suffering. God in heaven forbid. I just laugh when I hear some people say our citizens movement will split opposition votes. But the PDP is not in opposition to the APC. The candidate of the PDP has over the past 14 years gone from PDP to AC, AC to PDP, PDP to APC and now back to PDP. These people are brothers and sisters of iniquity and impoverishment, merchants of failure and disappointment. Don’t believe that 419! They are both part of a political ruling class that has held us bound, manipulated and diminished us for decades. Now they are auditioning to extend their streak of failure for another four years? God really forbid! The real opponent that the Nigerian people have in 2019 is this old political order that takes and takes and takes, and never replenishes anything. I should know. I was headhunted from Harvard in 1999, asked to come and help as a technocrat to rebuild a country that had just been recovered from the wasted years of the military. I accepted, like many other brilliant Nigerian minds from home and abroad, and we worked together to bring due process into government, secure debt relief, open up our economy, rebuild institutions and attack poverty. The things I saw with in those days really fired me up to insist on due process, fellow Nigerians. Because for these terrible Nigerian politicians, corruption is all fun and games. These people have no desire but for more power, power, power, power. They stay up at night conspiring to steal and pillage, to loot and destroy. Oh, my brothers and sisters, I served in that government with one of the candidates who is running under #APCPDP in this election. Kai! No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Six and a half years after, in 2007, I had fought the fight that had to be fought from within, and then I left government knowing for sure that if this politicial order is not changed, the work of good governance that good people do within government will never last. I decided not to re-enter government, rebuffing every request made since, and instead made a decision to dedicate my life to activating citizens to push these blood-sucking political class out of office. I returned from the World Bank five years later to do just that, and the PDP was still at it! Same incentives, same behavior. The political class was completely unchanged – and had in fact become completely worse.For goodness sake, what has fundamentally changed about that PDP we have always known? What lessons did the party really learn after its defeat in 2015? Is this not the same PDP that looted the monies meant to equip our military, so that our soldiers had to run away at the sight of Boko Haram, because they had no weapons? The same PDP that spent precious days denying that our Chibok girls were kidnapped and so allowed the terrorists get away? Is this not the same PDP that conducted a recruitment exercise for the Immigration Service that killed scores of our young people and yet nobody was sacked or punished? Haba. How can we forget so easily! So the question is: Apart from forgetfulness, why are some Nigerians suddenly considering the PDP yet again? I have heard some people say it is because the PDP candidate has run successful businesses and therefore will be good for the economy at a time like this.That response just makes me shake my head in wonderment: Is it the same person we know, or are we speaking of another? Perhaps you never read a 2005 email from the president of Atiku’s university which was obtained by US investigators.Let me quote a small portion from that mail: “…The flow of revenue to the university will slow dramatically if Atiku’s political fortunes continue to wane… Construction delays on campus have also raised fears that the prospects for the university are linked to Atiku’s political success.”Did you just hear what that email said? That the success of that man’s private business is dependent on our commonwealth? And there was more!
A special report by a US Senate Committee on Foreign Corruption concluded that “over an eight-year period from 2000 to 2008, Atiku and his wife, Jennifer Douglas were able to bring over $40 million in suspect funds into the United States…”This was at the very time that this person was the Vice President of this very same country. And these are the people you want to put in charge of the national treasury? In charge of the money for your children’s education? Of the resources for our country’s hospitals? Of the budget for our depleted army and our impoverished police force? If we dive into all the filthy issues involving the PDP candidate – from the PTDF saga to the $2.8 million Siemens bribery scandal – we may spend the entire day here today and I simply do not have that time.So let us talk about the present administration, the evil twin.What is the primary legacy of President Muhammadu Buhari? It is the destruction of our nation’s wealth, presiding over the worst economic recession Nigeria has seen in decades. Even now that the economy has come out of recession, the growth is as sluggish as his government. 4 out of every 10 adults today are either unemployed or underemployed, and Nigeria is now the Poverty Capital of the World, the World Bank confirmining that we now have more extremely poor people than India which has a population six times our size.And in the midst of this, his Vice President was celebrating last week at the Nigeria Economic Summit that handing bailouts to state governors to pay salaries is an achievement.
What a big shame!"
"Nigerians will not choose between corruption and incompetence, Oby Ezekwesili insists",https://guardian.ng/news/nigerians-will-not-choose-between-corruption-and-incompetence-oby-ezekwesili-insists/,"Presidential candidate of the Allied Congress Party of Nigeria (ACPN), Oby Ezekwesili, has stated that Nigerians will not choose between incompetence and corruption in next year’s general elections. Describing President Muhammadu Buhari’s administration as incompetent and sluggish, she said former Vice President Abubakar Atiku was corrupt. Ezekwesili, who spoke at a media briefing in Lagos yesterday cautioned that if Nigerians repeat the mistake of 2015 by choosing a lesser evil next year, the country would suffer its consequences. She also said Vice President Yemi Osinbajo’s celebration of bailouts, as an achievement of the present administration is a colossal shame, adding that the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and All Progressives Congress (APC) are like Siamese twins of failure and destruction. “In 2015, the chant all across the country was ‘Anyone But Jonathan.’ Sadly, that is how we ended up with this reprobate government. This time it is: ‘Anyone But Buhari.’ “And by that they mean that we should reinstate the failed PDP and its candidate, because they think he is the only person that can defeat Buhari in 2019 and in 2023 when Atiku and PDP fail again, because a bad tree cannot bear good fruits.”"
"Buhari lacks aptitude to lead Nigeria, says Ezekwesili",https://guardian.ng/news/buhari-lacks-aptitude-to-lead-nigeria-says-ezekwesili/,"The presidential candidate of the Allied Congress Party of Nigeria (ACPN),Oby Ezekwesili said President Muhammadu Buhari lacks the aptitude and capacity to continue to lead Africa’s most populous country. “President Muhammadu Buhari has now shown neither the capacity nor the aptitude for the highest office in the land,” Ezekwesili said on Monday at a press conference in Lagos as her party unveiled its road-map for winning the 2019 presidential elections. “Let us talk about the present administration; what is the primary legacy of President Muhammadu Buhari? It is the destruction of our nation’s wealth — presiding over the worse economic recession Nigeria has seen in decades. “Even now that the economy has come out of recession, the growth is as sluggish as its government. Four out of every 10 adults are either unemployed or underemployed and Nigeria is now the poverty capital of the world,” she added. The APCN presidential candidate accused Buhari of being the “most nepotistic and most partisan president that Nigeria has ever seen” and said that the president who rode on the promises to fight corruption in 2015 is also “corrupt”  “This president talks about fighting grand corruption. Please, please, give me a break! Can corruption fight corruption? Does he think we cannot see?” Ezekwesili said The Presidential hopeful, who was the minister of education under the People’s Democratic party-led administration, said the opposition party is not also a better alternative to move Nigeria forward. “I just laugh when I hear some people say our citizen’s movement will split opposition votes. But the PDP is not in opposition to the APC. The candidate of the PDP has over the past 14 years gone from PDP to AC, AC to PDP, PDP to APC and now back to PDP” Ezekwesili said Ezekwesili also took a swipe at Buhari and PDP’s presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar, noting that if she eventually becomes the Nigerian president, “you will never hear any world leader call me lifeless or dishonest.” “I have no issues obtaining visas or travelling to any country in the world – whether it is the United States of America or the United Arab Emirates,” she said in a not-so-veiled reference to the PDP presidential candidate.  Recently, Financial Times reported that the United States president Donald Trump referred to Buhari as “lifeless” shortly after a meeting between the two leaders in April. The PDP presidential candidate, on his part, is rumoured to be avoiding travelling to the United States because of a pending indictment. The former minister of education, while stating her achievement in office, said she “introduced Public Private Partnership models for education service delivery and very importantly ensured that Innovation & Vocational Enterprise Institutions were accredited, certified and regulated by the National Board for Technical Education.” Ezekwesili, therefore, affirmed that the ruling party and opposition party are “brothers and sisters of iniquity and impoverishment, merchants of failure and disappointment.”"
"‘Politics is the art of the impossible, made possible’",https://guardian.ng/guardian-woman/politics-is-the-art-of-the-impossible-made-possible/,"Otto Von Bismarck once said, “Politics is the art of the possible, the attainable – the art of the next best.” Some qualify that it is also the art of the impossible. Indeed, anything is possible, as seen by the huge shake-up in African Gender Politics this month, most recently this week with Ethiopia electing its first female President, not to mention Prime Minister Aby Ahmed appointing new female ministers and enabling the country to be the first African country with 50 per cent female ministers. Then earlier there was the unprecedented candidacy announcement of Oby Ezekwesili, who’s campaigning as “the anti-establishment candidate,” and labelled by the ACPN as the “hope” candidate, in a similar fashion to Obama, back in 2008. Sadly, Nigeria is ranked far lower than nations such as South Africa, Rwanda, Uganda, Zambia and Mauritania and most recently Ethiopia among countries that encourage women to engage in politics. Rwanda with its parliament being top in the world in female representation at over 60 per cent deliberately increased women in decision-making roles and the country is progressing well economically, despite its recent dark and genocidal past. Perhaps the presence of women will in itself prevent the country from ever repeating its atrocious history. Where African politics is concerned, we are often looking at impossible situations that need to be changed, and in many parts of Nigeria, that’s the case. But how can we expect change, without getting down to the crux of these matters? Meaning, community level politics, where locals can get together and discuss and decide what their needs are. There is too much power politics in Nigeria; it’s more about power rather than policy change up top. We need the balance of a bottom-up approach, and this is where we need women to get more involved. Mothers, the people concerned about the wellbeing of their families, having access to healthcare, getting their kids to school… Women’s approach to politics is usually less about power and more about trying to solve social problems. Of course there are exceptions to this rule but women tend to try to solve community level issues, and not just women’s issues. Some may doubt the electoral power of Ms Ezekwesili, but she’s well-known for leading the #BringBackOurGirls campaign, a former education minister and a former Vice President of the World Bank’s Africa division and she’s setting a great example. When it comes to politics, women generally want to get involved in social matters worldwide and there are more female celebrities becoming ambassadors to international organisations and travelling down to communities to “mother” them, be it for a short and temporary while. Because this is what women are good at. So, wake up, ladies of Nigeria. If you don’t get involved, nothing is going to change. Politics is the art of the impossible, made possible. Let’s turn our impossible situations into possible solutions. Nigeria, we have a lot of catching up to do. We women also have to help ourselves. I believe Nigeria will accept more women bringing more to the table, but we have to engage ourselves. The men are not going to force us to do so. Former president Olusegun Obasanjo has hailed female politicians as being more “trustworthy” and recently pointed out that “no nation will become great when half of her population ends up only in the kitchen and ‘the other room’, or get disproportionately discriminated against in the higher echelons of corporate management and in governance.”

Human rights and post-2019 presidency,https://guardian.ng/opinion/human-rights-and-post-2019-presidency/,"At the weekend, I got into a very lengthy conversation with my younger brother currently based abroad and who left Nigeria when his life became endangered by open threats made by some Islamists responsible for the spate of violent attacks targeting largely Christian communities in the North of Nigeria. Our conversations centred around the deteriorated security situations not just in Nigeria but in a lot of regional neighbouring communities making up the West African nations otherwise known as Economic Community of West African States.  There is also no doubt that Nigeria is the epicenter of the expanding frontiers of Islamic terrorism. But what really triggered this mutual but frank dialogue was the emergence on Sunday noon of the erstwhile vice president Alhaji Abubakar Atiku as the official standard bearer of the largest opposition political party in the sub-Saharan African region – the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Other notable Nigerians who are flying the presidential flags of some of the newly registered political parties include the former Vice President of the World’s Bank and erstwhile Education minister, Mrs. Oby Ezekwesili; former Deputy Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria and a Professor of Economics in a U.S. based university, Dr. Kingsley Moghalu and the former governor of Cross Rivets State, Mr. Donald Duke.  Emeka, my very brilliant younger sibling is a philosopher by academic qualification and an illustrious human rights practitioner.  He is one of the intellectuals backing and participating actively and constructively in the agitations for self-determination in Nigeria of the Igbo nationality as coordinated by a completely peace loving and unarmed group of human rights activists – Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB). In addition to threats of death from government agents involved in the enforced disappearances of reputable opponents of the political status quo in Nigeria, Nigeria has become polarized alongside ethno religious fault lines.  This highly cerebral philosopher brother of mine was basically concerned about the re-emergence as president for a second tenure of one of Nigeria’s most divisive and bigoted political leaders – the retired Army General Muhammadu Buhari in the year 2019 general elections. Put differently, Emeka asked to know the post-2019 human right agenda of the President who would emerge if a transparent election is conducted. His question is how the Nigerian people can basically safeguard the sanctity of the forthcoming election given the notoriety displayed by the central electoral governing and management council known in law as the Independent National Electoral Commission. His anxiety about the lack of credibility of the current head of the independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) is also shared by millions of Nigerians who watched with considerable trepidation as the electoral umpire rigged the recently held Osun State governorship poll. Two United States senators, Chris Coons (D-Del.) and Cory Booker (D-N.J.), both members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, have raised concerns about the credibility of elections in Nigeria following allegations of political interference in the latest governorship polls. Coons and Booker said in a joint statement that though the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) had been commended by observers for its conduct of the recent polls, concerns remained about the prospects of free and fair elections in the country. The statement read, “As members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, we are troubled by reports of incidents of political interference and intimidation of voters, journalists, and civil society observers in Nigeria by some security agencies and political party supporters. Nigeria is Africa’s largest economy and a key U.S. partner on the continent. “While domestic and international election observers have credited electoral authorities for their administration of elections thus far, we are concerned about the prospects for a free, fair and credible democratic process in Nigeria in light of recent interference by government security forces on peaceful assembly and freedom of expression, as well as ongoing security threats and communal tensions in several regions of the country. “General elections in February 2019 will be an important step for Nigeria to consolidate democratic gains achieved in the last two decades since the transition from military to civilian democratic rule. We are watching the parties’ primaries with interest, and we call on party leaders, electoral authorities, security officials, and all Nigerians to respect the political process and safeguard free, fair, credible, and peaceful elections that reflect the will of the people.” Recall that governorship elections were held on September 22 in Osun State and won by the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) after initially being declared inconclusive by INEC after PDP led. After the voting on September 22, the candidate of the main opposition party, Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Senator Ademola Adeleke, had won the majority of votes. He was followed by the APC candidate, Gboyega Oyetola. But INEC declared the election inconclusive and conducted a rerun on September 27. After adding up the votes, Oyetola was declared winner by INEC. The failure to declare PDP the winner is extra constitutional because the constitution says simple majority is the deciding factor for electoral victory in that category. INEC had also awarded the APC victory in an earlier controversial governorship poll in Ekiti State on July14. In both elections, PDP and other opposition elements alleged foul play and interference by the ruling APC. The worries expressed by these two United States’ parliamentarians cuts across the feelings of millions of Nigerians who have similar sentiments that there is no assurance that the electoral panel will be transparent and ready to conduct a free, fair, peaceful and transparent general elections come 2019. As observed by these Americans, the interferences into the election come majorly from the security forces. The apprehensions that the current heads of the internal security team will compromise the election finds supports in the fact that almost all the current heads of the different armed security institutions owed their unmerited retention to the current president who is desperate for a second tenure. There is therefore the imperative demand that the fuller intents of Section 158 (1) of the constitution is respected which means that whatever measures that are needed to be enforced to guarantee independence of the electoral commission should be put in place. Whereas the fundamental concern of my younger brother was on who is best suited to restore national stability and the security of lives and property of Nigerians, it is as clear as the early morning sunrise that the Buhari–led administration has failed in the discharge of the primary duty of government. The primary duty of government as enshrined in Section 14 (2) (b) of the constitution is as follows: “The security and welfare of the people shall be the primary purpose of government.” It is a fact that hundreds-of-thousands of Nigerians have left the shores of Nigerian since the emergence of the current government just as those who had earlier left due to security threats have found concrete, genuine, verifiable reasons to remain where they are or risks their lives by returning at this material time. In Benue State alone, more than 1,500 persons have been killed in the last three years due to the bloody insurgency of armed Fulani herdsmen who enjoy the protection of the current administration. Plateau state has been in turmoil due largely to the violent insurgency of armed Fulani herdsmen. Southern Kaduna and Nasarawa neighbouring Abuja has had their shares of these murderous and targeted killings of Christians.  Both in words and action, key functionaries of the current government have clearly backed the activities of the armed Fulani gangsters.  The minister of Defence was quoted as blaming the anti-open grazing laws in Benue State for the bloody attacks by Fulani herdsmen. Dan-Ali the Fulani born minister of Defence had told state house reporters that the blockage of cattle routes across the country is the remote cause of the killings by herdsmen. “Whatever crisis that happens at anytime, there are remote and immediate causes. Look at this issue (killings in Benue and Taraba) what is the remote cause of the farmers’ crisis? Since the nation’s independence, we know there used to be a route whereby the cattle rearers take because they are all over the nation. If you go to Bayelsa or Ogun, you will see them. If those routes are blocked, what do you expect will happen? These people are Nigerians. It is just like one going to block the shoreline; does that make sense to you? But the immediate cause is the grazing law.” Mansur Dan-Ali, in the aforementioned thoughtless statement has demonstrated the callous insensitivity of the Buhari’s administration to the violence unleashed on Nigerians by armed Fulani herdsmen.  This also shows why the major organisation backing the Fulani herdsmen known as Miyetti Allah Cattle Owners Association, has yet to be declared a terrorist group even when they back the killings.
To be continued on tomorrow.

Oby Ezekwesili: Nobility In Service,https://guardian.ng/life/oby-ezekwesili-nobility-in-service/," Obiageli Ezekwesili was born in 1963. Ezekwesili holds a master’s degree in International Law and Diplomacy from the University of Lagos, and a Master of Public Administration degree from the Kennedy School of Government, Harvard University.  Before she obeyed the national clarion call, she worked as a chartered accountant in Deloitte and Touche and at the Center for International Development, Harvard. Her stint with the government began with her appointment as the first head of the Budget Monitoring and Price Intelligence Unit (popularly known as Due Process Unit). During her time, she was credited with changing and cleansing the method of public procurement or contracting at the Federal level in Nigeria.
In June 2005, she was appointed the Minister of Solid Minerals (Mines and Steel) and again, she kicked off a reform programme that put Nigeria on the global platform as a mining investment destination.  A year later, she became the Federal Minister of Education and in March 2007, she was appointed her Vice president of World Bank Africa region.
The co-founder of Transparency International (TI) has been named in BBC’s 100 Women, Time 100 Most Influential People, New York Times 25 Women of Impact for 2015, Albert Einstein’s Foundation’s Genius:100 Visions of the Future. In 2014, she became a co-convener of the #BringBackOurGirls campaign, the campaign addressed the kidnap of the 300 Chibok girls which received global recognition.
Owing to her achievements and her “fight against corruption”, she was nominated a recipient of the 2018 Nobel Peace Prize. The Peace Research Institute Oslo (PRIO) director Henrik Urdal described as her “an international champion in the fight against corruption… Chairperson of the Nigeria Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (NEITI), leading the first-ever national implementation of the global EITI standards.”"
Ezekwesili picks Gani Galadima as running mate,https://guardian.ng/news/ezekwesili-picks-gani-galadima-as-running-mate/,"The presidential candidate of the Allied Congress Party of Nigeria (ACPN), Oby Ezekwesili, has picked Abdulganiy Galadima as her running mate for the 2019 presidential election. This was disclosed on Wednesday in Ilorin when the presidential hopeful unveiled her full manifesto themed #ProjectRescueNigeria Galadinma, while reacting to the announcement thanked Ezekweili for her confidence for giving him a very tasking mission to be embarked upon. “As your vice presidential candidate, I want to tell you, your excellency, that I will work with you,” Galadinma said. “I will work with you to go deep down to the grassroots, to move to the length and breadth of the country trying to see to the Nigerian people,” he added."
Oby Ezekwesili: For The Love Of Nigeria,https://guardian.ng/life/oby-ezekwesili-for-the-love-of-nigeria/," Oby Ezekwesili is in the race to dislodge faltering Nigeria’s President Muhammadu Buhari. But a year ago, upending the political status quo in Africa’s most populous nation was, perhaps, only a residual thought; not something she would have loved. Twice a minister, first for education and later solid minerals under President Olusegun Obasanjo, Ezekwesili is not alien to the workings of the government. Her effort to make government procurement processes accountable and transparent as the pioneer head of the Budget Monitoring and Price Intelligence Unit earned her the nickname Madam Due Process. Her penchant for wanting things done the right way was recently acknowledged by a former president of Malawi Dr Joyce Banda. Banda describes how Ezekwesili’s counsel helped her in fighting corruption in her country. “While fighting corruption during my Presidency in 2013, @obyezeks advised me to protect myself with a forensic audit, which UK gov supported. I am forever grateful for this transparent, accountable daughter of Africa, a servant leader pushing for a better Nigeria,” Banda tweeted on November 20. Oby Ezekwesili For someone who was once a minister, an appointment, which is usually a product of political affiliation and patronage, her hatred for politics can be blamed on the rot in Nigeria’s political system. “I never had interest in politics. Anyone who knows me knows that I detest politics,” she says. “But I had to get to the place where listening to the political class say to us that we have to choose the lesser of two evils got me infuriated.” One important driving force behind her decision to cast aside her hatred for politics is the way the human lives have been cheapened since the advent of President Muhammadu Buhari’s administration. Buhari defeated the then incumbent Goodluck Jonathan in Nigeria’s general elections after campaigning to fight corruption, reposition the economy and strengthen internal security, especially in the Northeast. Ezekwesili agrees that Buhari can be given a “little bit of score” for what he has done in the strife-torn region, but insists that a government that allowed Nigeria’s economy to tank on the “back of oil shock” and wrong policy choices should not be allowed to lead the country beyond May 29, 2019. Beyond the downward spiral of the economy which has seen the unemployment rate rise to 18.80 in Q3 2017 when the last job figures were released, Ezekwesili is miffed by the spate of violence across the country and a biased anti-graft war. “This is a Nigeria under President Muhammadu Buhari where the primacy of the human life has been completely devalued…life is cheapened,” she says. “The lives of Nigerians today are not any better because President Buhari became our president. As a matter of fact, the quality of lives has taken a significant beaten.” Her misgiving about Buhari’s handling of the economy preceded her dream of being the president of Nigeria. In 2016, she lampooned the government’s “command and control” economic policies while faulting the intention of the President Buhari to protect the poor. “The president comes into this economic philosophy on the premise that he does not want the poor to suffer. I can relate to that, a leader must not allow the poor to suffer, especially a leader who knows that most of his votes came not from the elite but from the poor,” she said at The Platform, a public policy forum, in April 2016. “The problem though is that the intention and the outcome are diverged.” Obviously, her patience to continue to “relate” to such “archaic” policies ran out. Oby Ezekwesili While Ezekwesili has her mind firmly set on dethroning Buhari when the country goes to poll in the first quarter of 2019, she has to contend with a political culture that is both anti-woman and excessively moneyed. The odds are staggering. But she insists that the “fight” for “a new independence from our rapacious ruling class” is winnable. She is very much convinced that she represents millions of Nigerians who are disenchanted by years of failure of the current and past administrations. “I am not running alone,” she says with a definite conviction. “We are all running. This contest is between the political class that has failed over and over against the Nigerian people and the Nigerian people.” But in a country where the voting public is easily ingratiated by quick and fleeting political favours and an entrenched political culture that has done little to curb electoral malpractices, how she will able to best her opponents is yet to be seen. It is impossible that Ezekwesili is unaware of these odds. Yet, she brims with the hope that her dream of repositioning Nigeria for a greater good will be realised. “I am the candidate of the people,” she remarks. Oby Ezekwesili Ezekwesili is not exactly new to facing down challenges. Her activism preceded the kidnapping of the Chibok girls in 2014. She was a member and the first female leader of The Concerned Professionals Citizens Movement. The group campaigned for Nigeria’s return to democracy in the 1990s. In recent years, she has been one of the most consistent voices against misrule and the excesses of the Nigerian political class. When the Chibok Girls were kidnapped from their schools in April 2014, she became a vocal advocate for their quick rescue. #BringBackOurGirls, a movement which she co-founded adopted a number of approaches -including sits-out and marches – to pressure the then President Goodluck Jonathan to act fast rescuing of the girls. Loyalists of the sitting Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) government accused her of being a paid agent. That led into her passport being briefly seized by the agents of the state when she was travelling to London in July 2014. When power changed hands in May 2015, Nigerians hoped the new government would introduce a new system of doing things. And for Ezekwesili, her travails in the hands of the government took a drastic turn. In January, she and seven other members of the BBOG movement were arrested and detained by police while protesting for the release for the Chibok Girls. In June, her one-man march on the Nigerian State House, Abuja to protest the killings of 100 persons by suspected herdsmen in Plateau communities in June was halted by security operatives. Again, she has been at the receiving end of attacks from loyalists of the current All Progressives Congress (APC), who felt her criticism of the Buhari administration was one too many, and from agents of the PDP, who thought she was beyond being forgiven for allegedly contributing to the party’s losses at the polls in 2015. But Ezekwesili insists her advocacy for the girl child and the woman will not take a back seat in spite of her personal dream of rescuing Nigeria from the grips APC and PDP. “Chibok girls, Leah Sharibu…will permanently remain the basis of my advocacy,” she tells Guardian Life. “The advocacy that we have done concerning Chibok girls and Leah Sharibu is one that is endless. It is never going to come to an end until those girls are back.” And there is always family and friends
Left to her husband, Chinedu Ezekwesili, she would have been into active politics much earlier. He has first-hand experience about how passionate she is about solving Nigeria’s problems. And when she eventually told him that she was going to contest the presidency, there was a eureka moment. “‘Finally, my baby is ready,’ he told me when I told him,” she says. Her three sons, on the other hand, were a bit worried. But they all gave their support to her aspirations. “Our children…they know how totally committed to Nigeria I am. Even though they worry, but on the aggregate, the whole idea is, ‘Mum, go ahead and do this.’” Ezekwesili firmly believes in a family creating a culture that works for its members, without anyone being unduly disadvantaged. “Every family where people act together don’t have to debate who does what,” she says. For anyone to be a functional member of a society, she says, possession of “all the [necessary] skills is important."
Oby Ezekwesili: Running Against Corruption,https://guardian.ng/life/oby-ezekwesili-running-against-corruption/," Since her entry into active politics, Oby Ezekwesili has become one of Nigeria’s mouthpiece. Unlike the characteristic nature of Nigerian public office holders of going into oblivion after serving, Ezekwesili has remained undaunted in ensuring that Nigeria is the country she dreams of. From her times as Madam Due Process because of her radical and transparent approach to eradicating all forms of damaging practices in the government procurement process to giving counsels that is used in different countries administrations to tackle corruption, there is no doubt that the former vice president of the World Bank for Africa is ready for the role as the country’s first position. With her campaign running, she says she never had an interest in politics…”But I had to get to the place where listening to the political class say to us that we have to choose the lesser of two evils got me infuriated,” she told Guardian Life. Speaking on the Bring Back Our Girls Campaign, a committed cause she is known for, she tells Guardian Life her experience including her one-man march. “This is a Nigeria under President Muhammadu Buhari where the primacy of the human life has been completely devalued…life is cheapened,” she says. Ezekwesili is also miffed by the spate of violence across the country and a biased anti-graft war.

"Buhari’s anti-graft war unspectacular, says Ezekwesili",https://guardian.ng/news/buharis-anti-graft-war-unspectacular-says-ezekwesili/,"Presidential aspirant, Oby Ezekwesili, on Wednesday, said that President Muhammadu Buhari has not done any spectacular work in his fight against corruption. While he was campaigning for presidency in 2015, Buhari’s manifesto was hinged on rebuilding the economy, a  strong anti-corruption war and a fight against insurgency. Buhari won at the presidential polls ahead of the then incumbent President Goodluck Jonathan, whose tenure had been riddled with allegations of grand scale corruption affecting even the fight against insurgents. However, three years into his tenure and months before the next general elections, the President, seeking re-election, has been accused of fighting a selective anti-corruption war. The Allied Congress for Progressives Change candidate said the anti-graft agencies including the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) are being used by the president to pick on members of opposition parties. “On corruption, President Buhari has not done any spectacular work,” Ezekwesili told Guardian TV. “What he has done is reduce the fight against corruption to a tunnel vision of EFCC hunting down those who have not joined the APC,” Ezekwesili said. “We are saying that fighting corruption is a comprehensive approach that looks at reducing opportunities of corruption through the kind of structural changes and systemic changes and policies that change the way that governments acts in an economy. “President Buhari has lived below the expectation of the integrity that he told us was his significant point or selling point on the basis of which Nigerians elected him.” Ezekwesili, who plans to unseat Buhari at the 2019 polls, insisted that Nigerians do not have to choose between two evils or choose the lesser evil. “Nigeria needs to be rescued from the entrenched system of politics that is a cyclical pattern of failure. We cannot be choosing any evil. We don’t need evil to fix the conditions that we have found ourselves. We need the right sets of thoughts in development. We need people with character, competence and capacity, who lead not for themselves but for the society,” she said. “I want to be that person that challenges this very artificial construct that Nigeria cannot amount to any good. We can fight and get Nigeria to that place of promise that it belongs.” The Bring Back our Girls convener noted that while there have been gains in the war against insurgency in the North east of Nigeria, the government still hasn’t taken Nigerians to the promised land. “The North east that was mostly occupied by the terrorist is not occupied to that extent. But people have not been able to all return to their neighbourhoods and communities. Lives have not been restored, we still have millions of our people in IDP camps,” Ezekwesili said. “This is the Nigeria under the President Muhammadu Buhari where the primacy of the human life has completely been devalued. Life is cheapened.” She also lamented the poor economic policies of the current government that has led the nation to be named the poverty capital by the World Poverty Clock. “The economy that was on an average growth of 5-6% was allowed to tank on the back of oil shock, but mostly because of very very wrong policy choices. the economic policy choices of the administration has put the economy in dire straits and that is something that we must fight. “The lives of Nigerians are not today any better because President Buhari became our president. The primacy of the human life has taken a significant beating.”"
Personal attacks as nature of presidential campaigns to come,https://guardian.ng/politics/personal-attacks-as-nature-of-presidential-campaigns-to-come/,"As the 2019 presidential election draws nearer, there are indications that the campaign would be characterised by personal attacks and brickbat. Already, opponents of President Mohammadu Buhari are pointing at loopholes in virtually all policies of his All Progressives Congress (APC) government. But what seems to be lacking is clear identification of the lapses and solutions to them. Prominent among the critics in recent time is the candidate of the Allied Congress Party of Nigeria (ACPN), Dr. Oby Ezekwesili. The one-time vice president of World Bank has on every available platform condemned the candidates of both Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and All Progressives Congress (APC), describing them as incompetent and corrupt. She maintained that the emergence of both Atiku Abubakar (PDP) and Mohammadu Buhari (APC) would amount to recycling of ‘political fraudsters’, which has slowed down the economic growth of the country. However, many Nigerians, think that the battle for Aso-Rock Villa is between the two vilified candidates (Buhari and Atiku), given their wide range of experience, political sagacity, structure and financial stamina to woo voters. Ezekwesili thinks otherwise, insisting that such opinion is only for the ignorant, and ought to fade off in the polity. According to her, the thought that some people are in control of some parts of the country, and so, will influence the election, is totally false. Citing example, she noted that the National Leader of APC, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu’s political strength is grossly overrated. Specifically, she noted that Tinubu, who most people think controls Lagos State, does not have control of Alimosho, the largest council area in the state, adding the he was only able to deliver 86,897 votes out of the 650,000 registered voters in Alimosho in the last presidential election. “Tinubu is believed to wield much power in the South-West. He worked for the election of President Muhammadu Buhari in 2015. Tinubu and his like in #APCPDP control only as much as we let them. Alimosho, for example, is the largest council area in Lagos State, with over 1.2 million residents, according to official census figures. In 2015, only about 650,000 of these people registered and obtained their Permanent Voters Cards (PVCs).” She added that it was because the people were faced with the unattractive choice of voting for PDP’s Goodluck Jonathan, or the anyone-but-Jonathan candidacy represented by Muhammadu Buhari, a great many voters chose to abstain from 2015 election. “At the end of the day, they only managed to conjure up 140,000 votes between them, in almighty Alimosho. This says something loud and clear that Tinubu, with all of his ‘might’ and experience in so-called grassroots politics, could, at the end of the day, deliver only 86,897 votes for his candidate Buhari and their party. Where then does the source of this his widely reported power come from? Isn’t he grossly overestimated?” ‘Butiku’
Ezekwesili, in skepticism, described the two parties as Siamese Twins that could not be separated by any doctor. She maintained that for those who have been saying that the 2019 election is anyone but Buhari would be surprised as they would be forced to sing the same song of anyone but Atiku in 2023. She maintained that both parties are not two but a single party fielding one single candidate, “and that candidate’s name is BuTiku. Yes, you heard me right, BuTiku.” She noted that any attempt to choose between the two is like asking somebody to choose between death by poison or death by gunshot. “God forbid. We cannot reject one oppressor and hand over to another. We do not love bondage. We do not enjoy suffering. God in heaven forbid. “I just laugh when I hear some people say our citizens movement will split opposition votes. But the PDP is not in opposition to the APC. The candidate of the PDP has over the past 14 years gone from PDP to AC, AC to PDP, PDP to APC and now back to PDP. These people are brothers and sisters of iniquity and impoverishment, merchants of failure and disappointment. Don’t believe that 419! They are both part of a political ruling class that has held us bound, manipulated and diminished us for decades. “Now they are auditioning to extend their streak of failure for another four years? God really forbid! The real opponent that the Nigerian people have in 2019 is this old political order that takes and takes and takes, and never replenishes anything.” ‘Obytiku’s visit’
Following Ezekwesili’s meeting with one of Nigeria’s former military rulers, Ibrahim Babangida, at his residence in Minna, Niger State, a lot of criticisms from Nigerians have assailed that visit, prominent among the critic is the presidential candidate of African Action Congress (AAC), Omoyele Sowore. Recall that Ezekwesili has been a critique of all previous governments in the country but on Monday, Ezekwesili tweeted that she met with Babangida to discuss how Nigeria must be taken out of the clutches of the old order in 2019. “I had a very candid conversation with former head of state, Ibrahim Babangida, in Minna after my speech on Human Capital Development at El Amin School. I made it clear that Nigeria must be taken out of the clutches of the Old Order. This is our mission,” she tweeted. Reacting to this, Sowore maintained that her meeting with the former military ruler should not have held. “Our dear Ezekwesili wants to stop corruption and mis-governance in Nigeria but then holds a secret session with the Godfather of corruption and bad governance, IBB. Nigerians, Ezekwesili creatively coined BUTIKU. I love it! But this single visit is OBYTIKU.” Ezekwesili warned against derogatory campaign
However, a group of Atiku’s supporters, under the aegis of Atiku for Better Nigeria, has warned Ezekwesili to desist from using derogatory remarks against Atiku and the Peoples Democratic Party, advising her to concentrate on her campaign and stop tagging other contestants and political parties as fraudsters. The group, in a statement by its National Coordinator, Benita Dike-Israel, advised Ezekwesili to learn the ropes in politics so as to avoid “falling into the abyss”. They argued that by painting Atiku and the PDP black, Ezekwesili was indicting herself and biting the fingers that fed her since she was a minister under the PDP regime. “Ezekwesili should learn not to be rude to Atiku or bite the fingers that fed her. For her to say that the PDP and Atiku lack knowledge in economy and (are) into 419 politics is self-indicting. That means her period, as Minister of Education and Solid Minerals added no value to the party that appointed her and to Nigeria as a whole; that also means that her immense credential amounts to naught and (she) has nothing new to offer. After all, a river is as good as its source; for whatever is built on void is void.” The Atiku supporters argued that by joining politics, Ezekwesili, who had been spearheading the campaign for the release of the abducted Chibok schoolgirls through the #BringBackOurGirls movement, had “diluted her fame and goodwill among ordinary Nigerians and friends of Nigeria.” According to the group, people will now begin to see Ezekwesili’s campaign for the release of the Chibok schoolgirls as “a mere ruse, smokescreen and cheap opportunity to feather her own political nest. Whereas it is her constitutional right as an eligible Nigerian to contest the election, yet she should understand politics as a game of persuasion and lobbying rather than (using) pressure group tactics of brick batting and (using) foul language. She can politicise without being rude and judgmental.”

Revisiting the Air Nigeria project,https://guardian.ng/opinion/revisiting-the-air-nigeria-project/,"Sir: When on July 18, 2018 Hadi Sirika, the Minister of State for Aviation, told a large audience, including aviation experts during a diplomatic trip to the United Kingdom of Nigeria preparedness to float Nigeria Air, many were ecstatic about the project. He said, the project was aimed at resurrecting the defunct Nigeria Airways. The project was said to bring about innovation in the Aviation sector of the country. It therefore, came as a quaking bombshell, when it was announced that the proposed project has been put on hold. One continues to wonder if the motive behind the project was well thought-out and planned, as the sudden suspension clearly portrays a wrong approach and perhaps wasteful decision.  Or how do you explain that a project supposedly well planned and driven actively was put on hold due to alleged investors’ apathy? It would be recalled that on July 18, 2018 at the Farnborough international Airshow in the UK, the Nigerian minister of state for aviation announced that the erstwhile Nigeria Airways will be making a return to the skies as Nigeria Air. The minister said the Nigerian government will inject 8.8 million dollars into Nigeria Air as viability gap funding. He said the private sector investors will bring some 300 million dollars as start-up capital.  Obviously, it was shocking when the public got to know that Nigerian Air may not fly for now. Perhaps the project would have continued if only communication was efficient or if knowledgeable Nigerians had been involved rather than the snippets dropped here and there by those in charge. Even the views of the Nigerian air operators were waved off as the experts foresaw loopholes in floating a National airline from scratch, when there were still many deficits on the act. One of the notable Nigerians who spoke against the investment was Oby Ezekwesili, the former minister of Education, who faulted the plan and financial implication of Nigerian Air. The decay of Nigeria Airways commenced in 2003, when planes became flying coffins due to substandard purchase of Aircraft. The Aviation industry has witnessed several losses of lives and property worth billions. Transportation by air became a risk to the masses, everything that could go wrong with the aviation sector did go wrong from the disengagement and payoff of the former staff still pending to the aborted or better still pending project of Nigeria Air. The project will continually be hollow and a mere drain pipe on the public fund at the expense of the Nigerian tax payer as long as the problem in the Air sector is not checked. Having a newly birthed Nigeria Air is a good and welcome development. However, it would have to go beyond Sirika’s optimism and nice words to become an achievable dream.  There must be a renewed commitment from the government and private sector players to see Nigeria Air work out, as Nigeria is a sleeping giant that has been stirred from sleep. The aviation sector is one of the sectors in the country’s economy that can shake up this giant to consciousness if well harnessed and utilised. Therefore, investors with sincere motives should be bought into plan. Also, there should be an agreed plan of such intended and magnificent project just as the place of private public partnership remains valid for this kind of idea. Furthermore, Air Nigeria should go beyond some set of political individuals. We have experts who are Nigerians and will be willing to be part of the think-thank on the initiative and this should be explored totally. Nevertheless, there should be political will to have Air Nigeria rather than vote appeal intention. A laudable project such as Air Nigeria is strategic to the economic growth of the nation and aviation sector. Government should endeavour to resuscitate it. It must not be allowed to die.

"Buhari’s government is corrupt, says Ezekwesili",https://guardian.ng/politics/buharis-government-is-corrupt-says-ezekwesili/,"A speech by Obiageli  ‘Oby’ Ezekwesili, presidential candidate of the Allied Congress Party of Nigeria at a World Press Conference on Monday, October 29, 2018 in Lagos. How can they say that we are finished?
We have just begun.
We have nowhere else to run to.
We have nowhere else to go. Ladies and gentlemen, you are welcome to this conference. When the singer TY Bello released that powerful anthem in 2011, Nigerians were on the march to a historic election. It was an election that showed us a vision of what is possible in our country – that the son of a humble fisherman from a minority tribe in the Niger Delta can rise to become president of the federal republic of Nigeria.The winner of that presidential election described his victory as “the renewal of hope” in Nigeria. And most Nigerians believed him.Until a series of own goals crashed that hope down a slippery slope, and that beautiful Nigerian dream tragically became a nightmare. In 2015, Nigerians were on the march again.
Citizens were so angry with the brand of failure posing as governance that we took a gamble and placed their hopes in today’s ruling party, the APC and President Muhammadu Buhari, a 71-year old former dictator who has now shown neither the capacity nor the aptitude for the highest office in the land. If that campaign was a movie, the title of the movie would be: “The lesser of two evils.”Everything the APC candidate did was justified and excused because he was branded as “the lesser evil.” He was given an easy ride. No serious questions were asked about his competence or track record or world view; he couldn’t even be bothered to attend a presidential debate to defend his ideas in a competitive environment. Yet he was promising CHANGE. And a majority of Nigerian voters bought what he was selling. But where is this change?
I intend to do three things here today:
First, I will lay bare what is at stake in this election by telling you why the failed PDP and its candidate, Atiku Abubakar, are not alternatives to the failed APC and its candidate, President Buhari. They are one and the same, siamese twins of failure and destruction.
Second, I will tell you why my candidacy under the Allied Congress Party of Nigeria (ACPN) represents the most prepared, most qualified and most formidable choice for 2019, and why you cannot afford to sit on the sidelines in this battle for the soul of Nigeria.Finally, I will address the most frequently repeated concerns about my candidacy and then what exactly we need to do to take this movement from here to Aso Rock. So let us look back briefly, to 2015
Do you remember? The chant all across the country was “Anyone But Jonathan.” Sadly, that is how we ended up with this reprobate government.
This time it is: “Anyone But Buhari.” And by that they mean that we should reinstate the failed PDP and its candidate, former vice president Atiku Abubakar because they think Atiku is the only person that can defeat Buhari in 2019. And in 2023, when Atiku and the PDP inevitably fail again, because a bad tree cannot bear good fruit? We will hear new chants of “Anyone But Atiku.”That is how we get looped in a cycle of insanity – repeating the same thing, and expecting a different result. That cycle of failure is unsustainable and it has to end NOW. 2019 cannot be “Anyone But Buhari”. Our country is not a recycling plant for uninspiring old men with their old ideas and old dubious characters. We deserve better than their aggressive mediocrity. And that is why I am running for president – to lead a people’s movement that will permanently terminate bad leadership, retire these incompetents and fight for every Nigerian. For those of you considering the PDP as an alternative, I really want to ask you: what is the thing that you see about them that is any different from the APC. Really? These people are the same: Siamese Twins of Failure.Fellow Nigerians, here is the truth of the matter: the APCPDP is not two parties. The #APCPDP is one single party fielding one single candidate, and that candidate’s name is #BuTiku. Yes, you heard me right – #BuTiku. Buhari and Atiku are conjoined from head to toe as #BuTiku. There is no lesser evil in #BuTiku. #BuTiku are members of the same party. Attempting to choose between these two is like asking one to choose between death by poison or death by gunshot. God forbid. We cannot reject one oppressor and hand over to another oppressor. We do not love bondage. We do not enjoy suffering. God in heaven forbid. I just laugh when I hear some people say our citizens movement will split opposition votes. But the PDP is not in opposition to the APC. The candidate of the PDP has over the past 14 years gone from PDP to AC, AC to PDP, PDP to APC and now back to PDP. These people are brothers and sisters of iniquity and impoverishment, merchants of failure and disappointment. Don’t believe that 419! They are both part of a political ruling class that has held us bound, manipulated and diminished us for decades. Now they are auditioning to extend their streak of failure for another four years? God really forbid! The real opponent that the Nigerian people have in 2019 is this old political order that takes and takes and takes, and never replenishes anything. I should know. I was headhunted from Harvard in 1999, asked to come and help as a technocrat to rebuild a country that had just been recovered from the wasted years of the military. I accepted, like many other brilliant Nigerian minds from home and abroad, and we worked together to bring due process into government, secure debt relief, open up our economy, rebuild institutions and attack poverty. The things I saw with in those days really fired me up to insist on due process, fellow Nigerians. Because for these terrible Nigerian politicians, corruption is all fun and games. These people have no desire but for more power, power, power, power. They stay up at night conspiring to steal and pillage, to loot and destroy. Oh, my brothers and sisters, I served in that government with one of the candidates who is running under #APCPDP in this election. Kai! No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Six and a half years after, in 2007, I had fought the fight that had to be fought from within, and then I left government knowing for sure that if this politicial order is not changed, the work of good governance that good people do within government will never last. I decided not to re-enter government, rebuffing every request made since, and instead made a decision to dedicate my life to activating citizens to push these blood-sucking political class out of office. I returned from the World Bank five years later to do just that, and the PDP was still at it! Same incentives, same behavior. The political class was completely unchanged – and had in fact become completely worse.For goodness sake, what has fundamentally changed about that PDP we have always known? What lessons did the party really learn after its defeat in 2015? Is this not the same PDP that looted the monies meant to equip our military, so that our soldiers had to run away at the sight of Boko Haram, because they had no weapons? The same PDP that spent precious days denying that our Chibok girls were kidnapped and so allowed the terrorists get away? Is this not the same PDP that conducted a recruitment exercise for the Immigration Service that killed scores of our young people and yet nobody was sacked or punished? Haba. How can we forget so easily! So the question is: Apart from forgetfulness, why are some Nigerians suddenly considering the PDP yet again? I have heard some people say it is because the PDP candidate has run successful businesses and therefore will be good for the economy at a time like this.That response just makes me shake my head in wonderment: Is it the same person we know, or are we speaking of another? Perhaps you never read a 2005 email from the president of Atiku’s university which was obtained by US investigators.Let me quote a small portion from that mail: “…The flow of revenue to the university will slow dramatically if Atiku’s political fortunes continue to wane… Construction delays on campus have also raised fears that the prospects for the university are linked to Atiku’s political success.”Did you just hear what that email said? That the success of that man’s private business is dependent on our commonwealth? And there was more!
A special report by a US Senate Committee on Foreign Corruption concluded that “over an eight-year period from 2000 to 2008, Atiku and his wife, Jennifer Douglas were able to bring over $40 million in suspect funds into the United States…”This was at the very time that this person was the Vice President of this very same country. And these are the people you want to put in charge of the national treasury? In charge of the money for your children’s education? Of the resources for our country’s hospitals? Of the budget for our depleted army and our impoverished police force? If we dive into all the filthy issues involving the PDP candidate – from the PTDF saga to the $2.8 million Siemens bribery scandal – we may spend the entire day here today and I simply do not have that time.So let us talk about the present administration, the evil twin.What is the primary legacy of President Muhammadu Buhari? It is the destruction of our nation’s wealth, presiding over the worst economic recession Nigeria has seen in decades. Even now that the economy has come out of recession, the growth is as sluggish as his government. 4 out of every 10 adults today are either unemployed or underemployed, and Nigeria is now the Poverty Capital of the World, the World Bank confirmining that we now have more extremely poor people than India which has a population six times our size.And in the midst of this, his Vice President was celebrating last week at the Nigeria Economic Summit that handing bailouts to state governors to pay salaries is an achievement.
What a big shame!"
"Nigerians will not choose between corruption and incompetence, Oby Ezekwesili insists",https://guardian.ng/news/nigerians-will-not-choose-between-corruption-and-incompetence-oby-ezekwesili-insists/,"Presidential candidate of the Allied Congress Party of Nigeria (ACPN), Oby Ezekwesili, has stated that Nigerians will not choose between incompetence and corruption in next year’s general elections. Describing President Muhammadu Buhari’s administration as incompetent and sluggish, she said former Vice President Abubakar Atiku was corrupt. Ezekwesili, who spoke at a media briefing in Lagos yesterday cautioned that if Nigerians repeat the mistake of 2015 by choosing a lesser evil next year, the country would suffer its consequences. She also said Vice President Yemi Osinbajo’s celebration of bailouts, as an achievement of the present administration is a colossal shame, adding that the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and All Progressives Congress (APC) are like Siamese twins of failure and destruction. “In 2015, the chant all across the country was ‘Anyone But Jonathan.’ Sadly, that is how we ended up with this reprobate government. This time it is: ‘Anyone But Buhari.’ “And by that they mean that we should reinstate the failed PDP and its candidate, because they think he is the only person that can defeat Buhari in 2019 and in 2023 when Atiku and PDP fail again, because a bad tree cannot bear good fruits.”"
"Buhari lacks aptitude to lead Nigeria, says Ezekwesili",https://guardian.ng/news/buhari-lacks-aptitude-to-lead-nigeria-says-ezekwesili/,"The presidential candidate of the Allied Congress Party of Nigeria (ACPN),Oby Ezekwesili said President Muhammadu Buhari lacks the aptitude and capacity to continue to lead Africa’s most populous country. “President Muhammadu Buhari has now shown neither the capacity nor the aptitude for the highest office in the land,” Ezekwesili said on Monday at a press conference in Lagos as her party unveiled its road-map for winning the 2019 presidential elections. “Let us talk about the present administration; what is the primary legacy of President Muhammadu Buhari? It is the destruction of our nation’s wealth — presiding over the worse economic recession Nigeria has seen in decades. “Even now that the economy has come out of recession, the growth is as sluggish as its government. Four out of every 10 adults are either unemployed or underemployed and Nigeria is now the poverty capital of the world,” she added. The APCN presidential candidate accused Buhari of being the “most nepotistic and most partisan president that Nigeria has ever seen” and said that the president who rode on the promises to fight corruption in 2015 is also “corrupt”  “This president talks about fighting grand corruption. Please, please, give me a break! Can corruption fight corruption? Does he think we cannot see?” Ezekwesili said The Presidential hopeful, who was the minister of education under the People’s Democratic party-led administration, said the opposition party is not also a better alternative to move Nigeria forward. “I just laugh when I hear some people say our citizen’s movement will split opposition votes. But the PDP is not in opposition to the APC. The candidate of the PDP has over the past 14 years gone from PDP to AC, AC to PDP, PDP to APC and now back to PDP” Ezekwesili said Ezekwesili also took a swipe at Buhari and PDP’s presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar, noting that if she eventually becomes the Nigerian president, “you will never hear any world leader call me lifeless or dishonest.” “I have no issues obtaining visas or travelling to any country in the world – whether it is the United States of America or the United Arab Emirates,” she said in a not-so-veiled reference to the PDP presidential candidate.  Recently, Financial Times reported that the United States president Donald Trump referred to Buhari as “lifeless” shortly after a meeting between the two leaders in April. The PDP presidential candidate, on his part, is rumoured to be avoiding travelling to the United States because of a pending indictment. The former minister of education, while stating her achievement in office, said she “introduced Public Private Partnership models for education service delivery and very importantly ensured that Innovation & Vocational Enterprise Institutions were accredited, certified and regulated by the National Board for Technical Education.” Ezekwesili, therefore, affirmed that the ruling party and opposition party are “brothers and sisters of iniquity and impoverishment, merchants of failure and disappointment.”"
"‘Politics is the art of the impossible, made possible’",https://guardian.ng/guardian-woman/politics-is-the-art-of-the-impossible-made-possible/,"Otto Von Bismarck once said, “Politics is the art of the possible, the attainable – the art of the next best.” Some qualify that it is also the art of the impossible. Indeed, anything is possible, as seen by the huge shake-up in African Gender Politics this month, most recently this week with Ethiopia electing its first female President, not to mention Prime Minister Aby Ahmed appointing new female ministers and enabling the country to be the first African country with 50 per cent female ministers. Then earlier there was the unprecedented candidacy announcement of Oby Ezekwesili, who’s campaigning as “the anti-establishment candidate,” and labelled by the ACPN as the “hope” candidate, in a similar fashion to Obama, back in 2008. Sadly, Nigeria is ranked far lower than nations such as South Africa, Rwanda, Uganda, Zambia and Mauritania and most recently Ethiopia among countries that encourage women to engage in politics. Rwanda with its parliament being top in the world in female representation at over 60 per cent deliberately increased women in decision-making roles and the country is progressing well economically, despite its recent dark and genocidal past. Perhaps the presence of women will in itself prevent the country from ever repeating its atrocious history. Where African politics is concerned, we are often looking at impossible situations that need to be changed, and in many parts of Nigeria, that’s the case. But how can we expect change, without getting down to the crux of these matters? Meaning, community level politics, where locals can get together and discuss and decide what their needs are. There is too much power politics in Nigeria; it’s more about power rather than policy change up top. We need the balance of a bottom-up approach, and this is where we need women to get more involved. Mothers, the people concerned about the wellbeing of their families, having access to healthcare, getting their kids to school… Women’s approach to politics is usually less about power and more about trying to solve social problems. Of course there are exceptions to this rule but women tend to try to solve community level issues, and not just women’s issues. Some may doubt the electoral power of Ms Ezekwesili, but she’s well-known for leading the #BringBackOurGirls campaign, a former education minister and a former Vice President of the World Bank’s Africa division and she’s setting a great example. When it comes to politics, women generally want to get involved in social matters worldwide and there are more female celebrities becoming ambassadors to international organisations and travelling down to communities to “mother” them, be it for a short and temporary while. Because this is what women are good at. So, wake up, ladies of Nigeria. If you don’t get involved, nothing is going to change. Politics is the art of the impossible, made possible. Let’s turn our impossible situations into possible solutions. Nigeria, we have a lot of catching up to do. We women also have to help ourselves. I believe Nigeria will accept more women bringing more to the table, but we have to engage ourselves. The men are not going to force us to do so. Former president Olusegun Obasanjo has hailed female politicians as being more “trustworthy” and recently pointed out that “no nation will become great when half of her population ends up only in the kitchen and ‘the other room’, or get disproportionately discriminated against in the higher echelons of corporate management and in governance.”

Human rights and post-2019 presidency,https://guardian.ng/opinion/human-rights-and-post-2019-presidency/,"At the weekend, I got into a very lengthy conversation with my younger brother currently based abroad and who left Nigeria when his life became endangered by open threats made by some Islamists responsible for the spate of violent attacks targeting largely Christian communities in the North of Nigeria. Our conversations centred around the deteriorated security situations not just in Nigeria but in a lot of regional neighbouring communities making up the West African nations otherwise known as Economic Community of West African States.  There is also no doubt that Nigeria is the epicenter of the expanding frontiers of Islamic terrorism. But what really triggered this mutual but frank dialogue was the emergence on Sunday noon of the erstwhile vice president Alhaji Abubakar Atiku as the official standard bearer of the largest opposition political party in the sub-Saharan African region – the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Other notable Nigerians who are flying the presidential flags of some of the newly registered political parties include the former Vice President of the World’s Bank and erstwhile Education minister, Mrs. Oby Ezekwesili; former Deputy Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria and a Professor of Economics in a U.S. based university, Dr. Kingsley Moghalu and the former governor of Cross Rivets State, Mr. Donald Duke.  Emeka, my very brilliant younger sibling is a philosopher by academic qualification and an illustrious human rights practitioner.  He is one of the intellectuals backing and participating actively and constructively in the agitations for self-determination in Nigeria of the Igbo nationality as coordinated by a completely peace loving and unarmed group of human rights activists – Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB). In addition to threats of death from government agents involved in the enforced disappearances of reputable opponents of the political status quo in Nigeria, Nigeria has become polarized alongside ethno religious fault lines.  This highly cerebral philosopher brother of mine was basically concerned about the re-emergence as president for a second tenure of one of Nigeria’s most divisive and bigoted political leaders – the retired Army General Muhammadu Buhari in the year 2019 general elections. Put differently, Emeka asked to know the post-2019 human right agenda of the President who would emerge if a transparent election is conducted. His question is how the Nigerian people can basically safeguard the sanctity of the forthcoming election given the notoriety displayed by the central electoral governing and management council known in law as the Independent National Electoral Commission. His anxiety about the lack of credibility of the current head of the independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) is also shared by millions of Nigerians who watched with considerable trepidation as the electoral umpire rigged the recently held Osun State governorship poll. Two United States senators, Chris Coons (D-Del.) and Cory Booker (D-N.J.), both members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, have raised concerns about the credibility of elections in Nigeria following allegations of political interference in the latest governorship polls. Coons and Booker said in a joint statement that though the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) had been commended by observers for its conduct of the recent polls, concerns remained about the prospects of free and fair elections in the country. The statement read, “As members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, we are troubled by reports of incidents of political interference and intimidation of voters, journalists, and civil society observers in Nigeria by some security agencies and political party supporters. Nigeria is Africa’s largest economy and a key U.S. partner on the continent. “While domestic and international election observers have credited electoral authorities for their administration of elections thus far, we are concerned about the prospects for a free, fair and credible democratic process in Nigeria in light of recent interference by government security forces on peaceful assembly and freedom of expression, as well as ongoing security threats and communal tensions in several regions of the country. “General elections in February 2019 will be an important step for Nigeria to consolidate democratic gains achieved in the last two decades since the transition from military to civilian democratic rule. We are watching the parties’ primaries with interest, and we call on party leaders, electoral authorities, security officials, and all Nigerians to respect the political process and safeguard free, fair, credible, and peaceful elections that reflect the will of the people.” Recall that governorship elections were held on September 22 in Osun State and won by the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) after initially being declared inconclusive by INEC after PDP led. After the voting on September 22, the candidate of the main opposition party, Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Senator Ademola Adeleke, had won the majority of votes. He was followed by the APC candidate, Gboyega Oyetola. But INEC declared the election inconclusive and conducted a rerun on September 27. After adding up the votes, Oyetola was declared winner by INEC. The failure to declare PDP the winner is extra constitutional because the constitution says simple majority is the deciding factor for electoral victory in that category. INEC had also awarded the APC victory in an earlier controversial governorship poll in Ekiti State on July14. In both elections, PDP and other opposition elements alleged foul play and interference by the ruling APC. The worries expressed by these two United States’ parliamentarians cuts across the feelings of millions of Nigerians who have similar sentiments that there is no assurance that the electoral panel will be transparent and ready to conduct a free, fair, peaceful and transparent general elections come 2019. As observed by these Americans, the interferences into the election come majorly from the security forces. The apprehensions that the current heads of the internal security team will compromise the election finds supports in the fact that almost all the current heads of the different armed security institutions owed their unmerited retention to the current president who is desperate for a second tenure. There is therefore the imperative demand that the fuller intents of Section 158 (1) of the constitution is respected which means that whatever measures that are needed to be enforced to guarantee independence of the electoral commission should be put in place. Whereas the fundamental concern of my younger brother was on who is best suited to restore national stability and the security of lives and property of Nigerians, it is as clear as the early morning sunrise that the Buhari–led administration has failed in the discharge of the primary duty of government. The primary duty of government as enshrined in Section 14 (2) (b) of the constitution is as follows: “The security and welfare of the people shall be the primary purpose of government.” It is a fact that hundreds-of-thousands of Nigerians have left the shores of Nigerian since the emergence of the current government just as those who had earlier left due to security threats have found concrete, genuine, verifiable reasons to remain where they are or risks their lives by returning at this material time. In Benue State alone, more than 1,500 persons have been killed in the last three years due to the bloody insurgency of armed Fulani herdsmen who enjoy the protection of the current administration. Plateau state has been in turmoil due largely to the violent insurgency of armed Fulani herdsmen. Southern Kaduna and Nasarawa neighbouring Abuja has had their shares of these murderous and targeted killings of Christians.  Both in words and action, key functionaries of the current government have clearly backed the activities of the armed Fulani gangsters.  The minister of Defence was quoted as blaming the anti-open grazing laws in Benue State for the bloody attacks by Fulani herdsmen. Dan-Ali the Fulani born minister of Defence had told state house reporters that the blockage of cattle routes across the country is the remote cause of the killings by herdsmen. “Whatever crisis that happens at anytime, there are remote and immediate causes. Look at this issue (killings in Benue and Taraba) what is the remote cause of the farmers’ crisis? Since the nation’s independence, we know there used to be a route whereby the cattle rearers take because they are all over the nation. If you go to Bayelsa or Ogun, you will see them. If those routes are blocked, what do you expect will happen? These people are Nigerians. It is just like one going to block the shoreline; does that make sense to you? But the immediate cause is the grazing law.” Mansur Dan-Ali, in the aforementioned thoughtless statement has demonstrated the callous insensitivity of the Buhari’s administration to the violence unleashed on Nigerians by armed Fulani herdsmen.  This also shows why the major organisation backing the Fulani herdsmen known as Miyetti Allah Cattle Owners Association, has yet to be declared a terrorist group even when they back the killings.
To be continued on tomorrow.

Oby Ezekwesili: Nobility In Service,https://guardian.ng/life/oby-ezekwesili-nobility-in-service/," Obiageli Ezekwesili was born in 1963. Ezekwesili holds a master’s degree in International Law and Diplomacy from the University of Lagos, and a Master of Public Administration degree from the Kennedy School of Government, Harvard University.  Before she obeyed the national clarion call, she worked as a chartered accountant in Deloitte and Touche and at the Center for International Development, Harvard. Her stint with the government began with her appointment as the first head of the Budget Monitoring and Price Intelligence Unit (popularly known as Due Process Unit). During her time, she was credited with changing and cleansing the method of public procurement or contracting at the Federal level in Nigeria.
In June 2005, she was appointed the Minister of Solid Minerals (Mines and Steel) and again, she kicked off a reform programme that put Nigeria on the global platform as a mining investment destination.  A year later, she became the Federal Minister of Education and in March 2007, she was appointed her Vice president of World Bank Africa region.
The co-founder of Transparency International (TI) has been named in BBC’s 100 Women, Time 100 Most Influential People, New York Times 25 Women of Impact for 2015, Albert Einstein’s Foundation’s Genius:100 Visions of the Future. In 2014, she became a co-convener of the #BringBackOurGirls campaign, the campaign addressed the kidnap of the 300 Chibok girls which received global recognition.
Owing to her achievements and her “fight against corruption”, she was nominated a recipient of the 2018 Nobel Peace Prize. The Peace Research Institute Oslo (PRIO) director Henrik Urdal described as her “an international champion in the fight against corruption… Chairperson of the Nigeria Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (NEITI), leading the first-ever national implementation of the global EITI standards.”"
Ezekwesili picks Gani Galadima as running mate,https://guardian.ng/news/ezekwesili-picks-gani-galadima-as-running-mate/,"The presidential candidate of the Allied Congress Party of Nigeria (ACPN), Oby Ezekwesili, has picked Abdulganiy Galadima as her running mate for the 2019 presidential election. This was disclosed on Wednesday in Ilorin when the presidential hopeful unveiled her full manifesto themed #ProjectRescueNigeria Galadinma, while reacting to the announcement thanked Ezekweili for her confidence for giving him a very tasking mission to be embarked upon. “As your vice presidential candidate, I want to tell you, your excellency, that I will work with you,” Galadinma said. “I will work with you to go deep down to the grassroots, to move to the length and breadth of the country trying to see to the Nigerian people,” he added."
Oby Ezekwesili: For The Love Of Nigeria,https://guardian.ng/life/oby-ezekwesili-for-the-love-of-nigeria/," Oby Ezekwesili is in the race to dislodge faltering Nigeria’s President Muhammadu Buhari. But a year ago, upending the political status quo in Africa’s most populous nation was, perhaps, only a residual thought; not something she would have loved. Twice a minister, first for education and later solid minerals under President Olusegun Obasanjo, Ezekwesili is not alien to the workings of the government. Her effort to make government procurement processes accountable and transparent as the pioneer head of the Budget Monitoring and Price Intelligence Unit earned her the nickname Madam Due Process. Her penchant for wanting things done the right way was recently acknowledged by a former president of Malawi Dr Joyce Banda. Banda describes how Ezekwesili’s counsel helped her in fighting corruption in her country. “While fighting corruption during my Presidency in 2013, @obyezeks advised me to protect myself with a forensic audit, which UK gov supported. I am forever grateful for this transparent, accountable daughter of Africa, a servant leader pushing for a better Nigeria,” Banda tweeted on November 20. Oby Ezekwesili For someone who was once a minister, an appointment, which is usually a product of political affiliation and patronage, her hatred for politics can be blamed on the rot in Nigeria’s political system. “I never had interest in politics. Anyone who knows me knows that I detest politics,” she says. “But I had to get to the place where listening to the political class say to us that we have to choose the lesser of two evils got me infuriated.” One important driving force behind her decision to cast aside her hatred for politics is the way the human lives have been cheapened since the advent of President Muhammadu Buhari’s administration. Buhari defeated the then incumbent Goodluck Jonathan in Nigeria’s general elections after campaigning to fight corruption, reposition the economy and strengthen internal security, especially in the Northeast. Ezekwesili agrees that Buhari can be given a “little bit of score” for what he has done in the strife-torn region, but insists that a government that allowed Nigeria’s economy to tank on the “back of oil shock” and wrong policy choices should not be allowed to lead the country beyond May 29, 2019. Beyond the downward spiral of the economy which has seen the unemployment rate rise to 18.80 in Q3 2017 when the last job figures were released, Ezekwesili is miffed by the spate of violence across the country and a biased anti-graft war. “This is a Nigeria under President Muhammadu Buhari where the primacy of the human life has been completely devalued…life is cheapened,” she says. “The lives of Nigerians today are not any better because President Buhari became our president. As a matter of fact, the quality of lives has taken a significant beaten.” Her misgiving about Buhari’s handling of the economy preceded her dream of being the president of Nigeria. In 2016, she lampooned the government’s “command and control” economic policies while faulting the intention of the President Buhari to protect the poor. “The president comes into this economic philosophy on the premise that he does not want the poor to suffer. I can relate to that, a leader must not allow the poor to suffer, especially a leader who knows that most of his votes came not from the elite but from the poor,” she said at The Platform, a public policy forum, in April 2016. “The problem though is that the intention and the outcome are diverged.” Obviously, her patience to continue to “relate” to such “archaic” policies ran out. Oby Ezekwesili While Ezekwesili has her mind firmly set on dethroning Buhari when the country goes to poll in the first quarter of 2019, she has to contend with a political culture that is both anti-woman and excessively moneyed. The odds are staggering. But she insists that the “fight” for “a new independence from our rapacious ruling class” is winnable. She is very much convinced that she represents millions of Nigerians who are disenchanted by years of failure of the current and past administrations. “I am not running alone,” she says with a definite conviction. “We are all running. This contest is between the political class that has failed over and over against the Nigerian people and the Nigerian people.” But in a country where the voting public is easily ingratiated by quick and fleeting political favours and an entrenched political culture that has done little to curb electoral malpractices, how she will able to best her opponents is yet to be seen. It is impossible that Ezekwesili is unaware of these odds. Yet, she brims with the hope that her dream of repositioning Nigeria for a greater good will be realised. “I am the candidate of the people,” she remarks. Oby Ezekwesili Ezekwesili is not exactly new to facing down challenges. Her activism preceded the kidnapping of the Chibok girls in 2014. She was a member and the first female leader of The Concerned Professionals Citizens Movement. The group campaigned for Nigeria’s return to democracy in the 1990s. In recent years, she has been one of the most consistent voices against misrule and the excesses of the Nigerian political class. When the Chibok Girls were kidnapped from their schools in April 2014, she became a vocal advocate for their quick rescue. #BringBackOurGirls, a movement which she co-founded adopted a number of approaches -including sits-out and marches – to pressure the then President Goodluck Jonathan to act fast rescuing of the girls. Loyalists of the sitting Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) government accused her of being a paid agent. That led into her passport being briefly seized by the agents of the state when she was travelling to London in July 2014. When power changed hands in May 2015, Nigerians hoped the new government would introduce a new system of doing things. And for Ezekwesili, her travails in the hands of the government took a drastic turn. In January, she and seven other members of the BBOG movement were arrested and detained by police while protesting for the release for the Chibok Girls. In June, her one-man march on the Nigerian State House, Abuja to protest the killings of 100 persons by suspected herdsmen in Plateau communities in June was halted by security operatives. Again, she has been at the receiving end of attacks from loyalists of the current All Progressives Congress (APC), who felt her criticism of the Buhari administration was one too many, and from agents of the PDP, who thought she was beyond being forgiven for allegedly contributing to the party’s losses at the polls in 2015. But Ezekwesili insists her advocacy for the girl child and the woman will not take a back seat in spite of her personal dream of rescuing Nigeria from the grips APC and PDP. “Chibok girls, Leah Sharibu…will permanently remain the basis of my advocacy,” she tells Guardian Life. “The advocacy that we have done concerning Chibok girls and Leah Sharibu is one that is endless. It is never going to come to an end until those girls are back.” And there is always family and friends
Left to her husband, Chinedu Ezekwesili, she would have been into active politics much earlier. He has first-hand experience about how passionate she is about solving Nigeria’s problems. And when she eventually told him that she was going to contest the presidency, there was a eureka moment. “‘Finally, my baby is ready,’ he told me when I told him,” she says. Her three sons, on the other hand, were a bit worried. But they all gave their support to her aspirations. “Our children…they know how totally committed to Nigeria I am. Even though they worry, but on the aggregate, the whole idea is, ‘Mum, go ahead and do this.’” Ezekwesili firmly believes in a family creating a culture that works for its members, without anyone being unduly disadvantaged. “Every family where people act together don’t have to debate who does what,” she says. For anyone to be a functional member of a society, she says, possession of “all the [necessary] skills is important."
Oby Ezekwesili: Running Against Corruption,https://guardian.ng/life/oby-ezekwesili-running-against-corruption/," Since her entry into active politics, Oby Ezekwesili has become one of Nigeria’s mouthpiece. Unlike the characteristic nature of Nigerian public office holders of going into oblivion after serving, Ezekwesili has remained undaunted in ensuring that Nigeria is the country she dreams of. From her times as Madam Due Process because of her radical and transparent approach to eradicating all forms of damaging practices in the government procurement process to giving counsels that is used in different countries administrations to tackle corruption, there is no doubt that the former vice president of the World Bank for Africa is ready for the role as the country’s first position. With her campaign running, she says she never had an interest in politics…”But I had to get to the place where listening to the political class say to us that we have to choose the lesser of two evils got me infuriated,” she told Guardian Life. Speaking on the Bring Back Our Girls Campaign, a committed cause she is known for, she tells Guardian Life her experience including her one-man march. “This is a Nigeria under President Muhammadu Buhari where the primacy of the human life has been completely devalued…life is cheapened,” she says. Ezekwesili is also miffed by the spate of violence across the country and a biased anti-graft war.
She is very much convinced that she represents millions of Nigerians who are disenchanted by years of failure of the current and past administrations.

"Buhari’s anti-graft war unspectacular, says Ezekwesili",https://guardian.ng/news/buharis-anti-graft-war-unspectacular-says-ezekwesili/,"Presidential aspirant, Oby Ezekwesili, on Wednesday, said that President Muhammadu Buhari has not done any spectacular work in his fight against corruption. While he was campaigning for presidency in 2015, Buhari’s manifesto was hinged on rebuilding the economy, a  strong anti-corruption war and a fight against insurgency. Buhari won at the presidential polls ahead of the then incumbent President Goodluck Jonathan, whose tenure had been riddled with allegations of grand scale corruption affecting even the fight against insurgents. However, three years into his tenure and months before the next general elections, the President, seeking re-election, has been accused of fighting a selective anti-corruption war. The Allied Congress for Progressives Change candidate said the anti-graft agencies including the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) are being used by the president to pick on members of opposition parties. “On corruption, President Buhari has not done any spectacular work,” Ezekwesili told Guardian TV. “What he has done is reduce the fight against corruption to a tunnel vision of EFCC hunting down those who have not joined the APC,” Ezekwesili said. “We are saying that fighting corruption is a comprehensive approach that looks at reducing opportunities of corruption through the kind of structural changes and systemic changes and policies that change the way that governments acts in an economy. “President Buhari has lived below the expectation of the integrity that he told us was his significant point or selling point on the basis of which Nigerians elected him.” Ezekwesili, who plans to unseat Buhari at the 2019 polls, insisted that Nigerians do not have to choose between two evils or choose the lesser evil. “Nigeria needs to be rescued from the entrenched system of politics that is a cyclical pattern of failure. We cannot be choosing any evil. We don’t need evil to fix the conditions that we have found ourselves. We need the right sets of thoughts in development. We need people with character, competence and capacity, who lead not for themselves but for the society,” she said. “I want to be that person that challenges this very artificial construct that Nigeria cannot amount to any good. We can fight and get Nigeria to that place of promise that it belongs.” The Bring Back our Girls convener noted that while there have been gains in the war against insurgency in the North east of Nigeria, the government still hasn’t taken Nigerians to the promised land. “The North east that was mostly occupied by the terrorist is not occupied to that extent. But people have not been able to all return to their neighbourhoods and communities. Lives have not been restored, we still have millions of our people in IDP camps,” Ezekwesili said. “This is the Nigeria under the President Muhammadu Buhari where the primacy of the human life has completely been devalued. Life is cheapened.” She also lamented the poor economic policies of the current government that has led the nation to be named the poverty capital by the World Poverty Clock. “The economy that was on an average growth of 5-6% was allowed to tank on the back of oil shock, but mostly because of very very wrong policy choices. the economic policy choices of the administration has put the economy in dire straits and that is something that we must fight. “The lives of Nigerians are not today any better because President Buhari became our president. The primacy of the human life has taken a significant beating.”"
Personal attacks as nature of presidential campaigns to come,https://guardian.ng/politics/personal-attacks-as-nature-of-presidential-campaigns-to-come/,"As the 2019 presidential election draws nearer, there are indications that the campaign would be characterised by personal attacks and brickbat. Already, opponents of President Mohammadu Buhari are pointing at loopholes in virtually all policies of his All Progressives Congress (APC) government. But what seems to be lacking is clear identification of the lapses and solutions to them. Prominent among the critics in recent time is the candidate of the Allied Congress Party of Nigeria (ACPN), Dr. Oby Ezekwesili. The one-time vice president of World Bank has on every available platform condemned the candidates of both Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and All Progressives Congress (APC), describing them as incompetent and corrupt. She maintained that the emergence of both Atiku Abubakar (PDP) and Mohammadu Buhari (APC) would amount to recycling of ‘political fraudsters’, which has slowed down the economic growth of the country. However, many Nigerians, think that the battle for Aso-Rock Villa is between the two vilified candidates (Buhari and Atiku), given their wide range of experience, political sagacity, structure and financial stamina to woo voters. Ezekwesili thinks otherwise, insisting that such opinion is only for the ignorant, and ought to fade off in the polity. According to her, the thought that some people are in control of some parts of the country, and so, will influence the election, is totally false. Citing example, she noted that the National Leader of APC, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu’s political strength is grossly overrated. Specifically, she noted that Tinubu, who most people think controls Lagos State, does not have control of Alimosho, the largest council area in the state, adding the he was only able to deliver 86,897 votes out of the 650,000 registered voters in Alimosho in the last presidential election. “Tinubu is believed to wield much power in the South-West. He worked for the election of President Muhammadu Buhari in 2015. Tinubu and his like in #APCPDP control only as much as we let them. Alimosho, for example, is the largest council area in Lagos State, with over 1.2 million residents, according to official census figures. In 2015, only about 650,000 of these people registered and obtained their Permanent Voters Cards (PVCs).” She added that it was because the people were faced with the unattractive choice of voting for PDP’s Goodluck Jonathan, or the anyone-but-Jonathan candidacy represented by Muhammadu Buhari, a great many voters chose to abstain from 2015 election. “At the end of the day, they only managed to conjure up 140,000 votes between them, in almighty Alimosho. This says something loud and clear that Tinubu, with all of his ‘might’ and experience in so-called grassroots politics, could, at the end of the day, deliver only 86,897 votes for his candidate Buhari and their party. Where then does the source of this his widely reported power come from? Isn’t he grossly overestimated?” ‘Butiku’
Ezekwesili, in skepticism, described the two parties as Siamese Twins that could not be separated by any doctor. She maintained that for those who have been saying that the 2019 election is anyone but Buhari would be surprised as they would be forced to sing the same song of anyone but Atiku in 2023. She maintained that both parties are not two but a single party fielding one single candidate, “and that candidate’s name is BuTiku. Yes, you heard me right, BuTiku.” She noted that any attempt to choose between the two is like asking somebody to choose between death by poison or death by gunshot. “God forbid. We cannot reject one oppressor and hand over to another. We do not love bondage. We do not enjoy suffering. God in heaven forbid. “I just laugh when I hear some people say our citizens movement will split opposition votes. But the PDP is not in opposition to the APC. The candidate of the PDP has over the past 14 years gone from PDP to AC, AC to PDP, PDP to APC and now back to PDP. These people are brothers and sisters of iniquity and impoverishment, merchants of failure and disappointment. Don’t believe that 419! They are both part of a political ruling class that has held us bound, manipulated and diminished us for decades. “Now they are auditioning to extend their streak of failure for another four years? God really forbid! The real opponent that the Nigerian people have in 2019 is this old political order that takes and takes and takes, and never replenishes anything.” ‘Obytiku’s visit’
Following Ezekwesili’s meeting with one of Nigeria’s former military rulers, Ibrahim Babangida, at his residence in Minna, Niger State, a lot of criticisms from Nigerians have assailed that visit, prominent among the critic is the presidential candidate of African Action Congress (AAC), Omoyele Sowore. Recall that Ezekwesili has been a critique of all previous governments in the country but on Monday, Ezekwesili tweeted that she met with Babangida to discuss how Nigeria must be taken out of the clutches of the old order in 2019. “I had a very candid conversation with former head of state, Ibrahim Babangida, in Minna after my speech on Human Capital Development at El Amin School. I made it clear that Nigeria must be taken out of the clutches of the Old Order. This is our mission,” she tweeted. Reacting to this, Sowore maintained that her meeting with the former military ruler should not have held. “Our dear Ezekwesili wants to stop corruption and mis-governance in Nigeria but then holds a secret session with the Godfather of corruption and bad governance, IBB. Nigerians, Ezekwesili creatively coined BUTIKU. I love it! But this single visit is OBYTIKU.” Ezekwesili warned against derogatory campaign
However, a group of Atiku’s supporters, under the aegis of Atiku for Better Nigeria, has warned Ezekwesili to desist from using derogatory remarks against Atiku and the Peoples Democratic Party, advising her to concentrate on her campaign and stop tagging other contestants and political parties as fraudsters. The group, in a statement by its National Coordinator, Benita Dike-Israel, advised Ezekwesili to learn the ropes in politics so as to avoid “falling into the abyss”. They argued that by painting Atiku and the PDP black, Ezekwesili was indicting herself and biting the fingers that fed her since she was a minister under the PDP regime. “Ezekwesili should learn not to be rude to Atiku or bite the fingers that fed her. For her to say that the PDP and Atiku lack knowledge in economy and (are) into 419 politics is self-indicting. That means her period, as Minister of Education and Solid Minerals added no value to the party that appointed her and to Nigeria as a whole; that also means that her immense credential amounts to naught and (she) has nothing new to offer. After all, a river is as good as its source; for whatever is built on void is void.” The Atiku supporters argued that by joining politics, Ezekwesili, who had been spearheading the campaign for the release of the abducted Chibok schoolgirls through the #BringBackOurGirls movement, had “diluted her fame and goodwill among ordinary Nigerians and friends of Nigeria.” According to the group, people will now begin to see Ezekwesili’s campaign for the release of the Chibok schoolgirls as “a mere ruse, smokescreen and cheap opportunity to feather her own political nest. Whereas it is her constitutional right as an eligible Nigerian to contest the election, yet she should understand politics as a game of persuasion and lobbying rather than (using) pressure group tactics of brick batting and (using) foul language. She can politicise without being rude and judgmental.”

Revisiting the Air Nigeria project,https://guardian.ng/opinion/revisiting-the-air-nigeria-project/,"Sir: When on July 18, 2018 Hadi Sirika, the Minister of State for Aviation, told a large audience, including aviation experts during a diplomatic trip to the United Kingdom of Nigeria preparedness to float Nigeria Air, many were ecstatic about the project. He said, the project was aimed at resurrecting the defunct Nigeria Airways. The project was said to bring about innovation in the Aviation sector of the country. It therefore, came as a quaking bombshell, when it was announced that the proposed project has been put on hold. One continues to wonder if the motive behind the project was well thought-out and planned, as the sudden suspension clearly portrays a wrong approach and perhaps wasteful decision.  Or how do you explain that a project supposedly well planned and driven actively was put on hold due to alleged investors’ apathy? It would be recalled that on July 18, 2018 at the Farnborough international Airshow in the UK, the Nigerian minister of state for aviation announced that the erstwhile Nigeria Airways will be making a return to the skies as Nigeria Air. The minister said the Nigerian government will inject 8.8 million dollars into Nigeria Air as viability gap funding. He said the private sector investors will bring some 300 million dollars as start-up capital.  Obviously, it was shocking when the public got to know that Nigerian Air may not fly for now. Perhaps the project would have continued if only communication was efficient or if knowledgeable Nigerians had been involved rather than the snippets dropped here and there by those in charge. Even the views of the Nigerian air operators were waved off as the experts foresaw loopholes in floating a National airline from scratch, when there were still many deficits on the act. One of the notable Nigerians who spoke against the investment was Oby Ezekwesili, the former minister of Education, who faulted the plan and financial implication of Nigerian Air. The decay of Nigeria Airways commenced in 2003, when planes became flying coffins due to substandard purchase of Aircraft. The Aviation industry has witnessed several losses of lives and property worth billions. Transportation by air became a risk to the masses, everything that could go wrong with the aviation sector did go wrong from the disengagement and payoff of the former staff still pending to the aborted or better still pending project of Nigeria Air. The project will continually be hollow and a mere drain pipe on the public fund at the expense of the Nigerian tax payer as long as the problem in the Air sector is not checked. Having a newly birthed Nigeria Air is a good and welcome development. However, it would have to go beyond Sirika’s optimism and nice words to become an achievable dream.  There must be a renewed commitment from the government and private sector players to see Nigeria Air work out, as Nigeria is a sleeping giant that has been stirred from sleep. The aviation sector is one of the sectors in the country’s economy that can shake up this giant to consciousness if well harnessed and utilised. Therefore, investors with sincere motives should be bought into plan. Also, there should be an agreed plan of such intended and magnificent project just as the place of private public partnership remains valid for this kind of idea. Furthermore, Air Nigeria should go beyond some set of political individuals. We have experts who are Nigerians and will be willing to be part of the think-thank on the initiative and this should be explored totally. Nevertheless, there should be political will to have Air Nigeria rather than vote appeal intention. A laudable project such as Air Nigeria is strategic to the economic growth of the nation and aviation sector. Government should endeavour to resuscitate it. It must not be allowed to die.

"Buhari’s government is corrupt, says Ezekwesili",https://guardian.ng/politics/buharis-government-is-corrupt-says-ezekwesili/,"A speech by Obiageli  ‘Oby’ Ezekwesili, presidential candidate of the Allied Congress Party of Nigeria at a World Press Conference on Monday, October 29, 2018 in Lagos. How can they say that we are finished?
We have just begun.
We have nowhere else to run to.
We have nowhere else to go. Ladies and gentlemen, you are welcome to this conference. When the singer TY Bello released that powerful anthem in 2011, Nigerians were on the march to a historic election. It was an election that showed us a vision of what is possible in our country – that the son of a humble fisherman from a minority tribe in the Niger Delta can rise to become president of the federal republic of Nigeria.The winner of that presidential election described his victory as “the renewal of hope” in Nigeria. And most Nigerians believed him.Until a series of own goals crashed that hope down a slippery slope, and that beautiful Nigerian dream tragically became a nightmare. In 2015, Nigerians were on the march again.
Citizens were so angry with the brand of failure posing as governance that we took a gamble and placed their hopes in today’s ruling party, the APC and President Muhammadu Buhari, a 71-year old former dictator who has now shown neither the capacity nor the aptitude for the highest office in the land. If that campaign was a movie, the title of the movie would be: “The lesser of two evils.”Everything the APC candidate did was justified and excused because he was branded as “the lesser evil.” He was given an easy ride. No serious questions were asked about his competence or track record or world view; he couldn’t even be bothered to attend a presidential debate to defend his ideas in a competitive environment. Yet he was promising CHANGE. And a majority of Nigerian voters bought what he was selling. But where is this change?
I intend to do three things here today:
First, I will lay bare what is at stake in this election by telling you why the failed PDP and its candidate, Atiku Abubakar, are not alternatives to the failed APC and its candidate, President Buhari. They are one and the same, siamese twins of failure and destruction.
Second, I will tell you why my candidacy under the Allied Congress Party of Nigeria (ACPN) represents the most prepared, most qualified and most formidable choice for 2019, and why you cannot afford to sit on the sidelines in this battle for the soul of Nigeria.Finally, I will address the most frequently repeated concerns about my candidacy and then what exactly we need to do to take this movement from here to Aso Rock. So let us look back briefly, to 2015
Do you remember? The chant all across the country was “Anyone But Jonathan.” Sadly, that is how we ended up with this reprobate government.
This time it is: “Anyone But Buhari.” And by that they mean that we should reinstate the failed PDP and its candidate, former vice president Atiku Abubakar because they think Atiku is the only person that can defeat Buhari in 2019. And in 2023, when Atiku and the PDP inevitably fail again, because a bad tree cannot bear good fruit? We will hear new chants of “Anyone But Atiku.”That is how we get looped in a cycle of insanity – repeating the same thing, and expecting a different result. That cycle of failure is unsustainable and it has to end NOW. 2019 cannot be “Anyone But Buhari”. Our country is not a recycling plant for uninspiring old men with their old ideas and old dubious characters. We deserve better than their aggressive mediocrity. And that is why I am running for president – to lead a people’s movement that will permanently terminate bad leadership, retire these incompetents and fight for every Nigerian. For those of you considering the PDP as an alternative, I really want to ask you: what is the thing that you see about them that is any different from the APC. Really? These people are the same: Siamese Twins of Failure.Fellow Nigerians, here is the truth of the matter: the APCPDP is not two parties. The #APCPDP is one single party fielding one single candidate, and that candidate’s name is #BuTiku. Yes, you heard me right – #BuTiku. Buhari and Atiku are conjoined from head to toe as #BuTiku. There is no lesser evil in #BuTiku. #BuTiku are members of the same party. Attempting to choose between these two is like asking one to choose between death by poison or death by gunshot. God forbid. We cannot reject one oppressor and hand over to another oppressor. We do not love bondage. We do not enjoy suffering. God in heaven forbid. I just laugh when I hear some people say our citizens movement will split opposition votes. But the PDP is not in opposition to the APC. The candidate of the PDP has over the past 14 years gone from PDP to AC, AC to PDP, PDP to APC and now back to PDP. These people are brothers and sisters of iniquity and impoverishment, merchants of failure and disappointment. Don’t believe that 419! They are both part of a political ruling class that has held us bound, manipulated and diminished us for decades. Now they are auditioning to extend their streak of failure for another four years? God really forbid! The real opponent that the Nigerian people have in 2019 is this old political order that takes and takes and takes, and never replenishes anything. I should know. I was headhunted from Harvard in 1999, asked to come and help as a technocrat to rebuild a country that had just been recovered from the wasted years of the military. I accepted, like many other brilliant Nigerian minds from home and abroad, and we worked together to bring due process into government, secure debt relief, open up our economy, rebuild institutions and attack poverty. The things I saw with in those days really fired me up to insist on due process, fellow Nigerians. Because for these terrible Nigerian politicians, corruption is all fun and games. These people have no desire but for more power, power, power, power. They stay up at night conspiring to steal and pillage, to loot and destroy. Oh, my brothers and sisters, I served in that government with one of the candidates who is running under #APCPDP in this election. Kai! No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Six and a half years after, in 2007, I had fought the fight that had to be fought from within, and then I left government knowing for sure that if this politicial order is not changed, the work of good governance that good people do within government will never last. I decided not to re-enter government, rebuffing every request made since, and instead made a decision to dedicate my life to activating citizens to push these blood-sucking political class out of office. I returned from the World Bank five years later to do just that, and the PDP was still at it! Same incentives, same behavior. The political class was completely unchanged – and had in fact become completely worse.For goodness sake, what has fundamentally changed about that PDP we have always known? What lessons did the party really learn after its defeat in 2015? Is this not the same PDP that looted the monies meant to equip our military, so that our soldiers had to run away at the sight of Boko Haram, because they had no weapons? The same PDP that spent precious days denying that our Chibok girls were kidnapped and so allowed the terrorists get away? Is this not the same PDP that conducted a recruitment exercise for the Immigration Service that killed scores of our young people and yet nobody was sacked or punished? Haba. How can we forget so easily! So the question is: Apart from forgetfulness, why are some Nigerians suddenly considering the PDP yet again? I have heard some people say it is because the PDP candidate has run successful businesses and therefore will be good for the economy at a time like this.That response just makes me shake my head in wonderment: Is it the same person we know, or are we speaking of another? Perhaps you never read a 2005 email from the president of Atiku’s university which was obtained by US investigators.Let me quote a small portion from that mail: “…The flow of revenue to the university will slow dramatically if Atiku’s political fortunes continue to wane… Construction delays on campus have also raised fears that the prospects for the university are linked to Atiku’s political success.”Did you just hear what that email said? That the success of that man’s private business is dependent on our commonwealth? And there was more!
A special report by a US Senate Committee on Foreign Corruption concluded that “over an eight-year period from 2000 to 2008, Atiku and his wife, Jennifer Douglas were able to bring over $40 million in suspect funds into the United States…”This was at the very time that this person was the Vice President of this very same country. And these are the people you want to put in charge of the national treasury? In charge of the money for your children’s education? Of the resources for our country’s hospitals? Of the budget for our depleted army and our impoverished police force? If we dive into all the filthy issues involving the PDP candidate – from the PTDF saga to the $2.8 million Siemens bribery scandal – we may spend the entire day here today and I simply do not have that time.So let us talk about the present administration, the evil twin.What is the primary legacy of President Muhammadu Buhari? It is the destruction of our nation’s wealth, presiding over the worst economic recession Nigeria has seen in decades. Even now that the economy has come out of recession, the growth is as sluggish as his government. 4 out of every 10 adults today are either unemployed or underemployed, and Nigeria is now the Poverty Capital of the World, the World Bank confirmining that we now have more extremely poor people than India which has a population six times our size.And in the midst of this, his Vice President was celebrating last week at the Nigeria Economic Summit that handing bailouts to state governors to pay salaries is an achievement.
What a big shame!"
"Nigerians will not choose between corruption and incompetence, Oby Ezekwesili insists",https://guardian.ng/news/nigerians-will-not-choose-between-corruption-and-incompetence-oby-ezekwesili-insists/,"Presidential candidate of the Allied Congress Party of Nigeria (ACPN), Oby Ezekwesili, has stated that Nigerians will not choose between incompetence and corruption in next year’s general elections. Describing President Muhammadu Buhari’s administration as incompetent and sluggish, she said former Vice President Abubakar Atiku was corrupt. Ezekwesili, who spoke at a media briefing in Lagos yesterday cautioned that if Nigerians repeat the mistake of 2015 by choosing a lesser evil next year, the country would suffer its consequences. She also said Vice President Yemi Osinbajo’s celebration of bailouts, as an achievement of the present administration is a colossal shame, adding that the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and All Progressives Congress (APC) are like Siamese twins of failure and destruction. “In 2015, the chant all across the country was ‘Anyone But Jonathan.’ Sadly, that is how we ended up with this reprobate government. This time it is: ‘Anyone But Buhari.’ “And by that they mean that we should reinstate the failed PDP and its candidate, because they think he is the only person that can defeat Buhari in 2019 and in 2023 when Atiku and PDP fail again, because a bad tree cannot bear good fruits.”"
"Buhari lacks aptitude to lead Nigeria, says Ezekwesili",https://guardian.ng/news/buhari-lacks-aptitude-to-lead-nigeria-says-ezekwesili/,"The presidential candidate of the Allied Congress Party of Nigeria (ACPN),Oby Ezekwesili said President Muhammadu Buhari lacks the aptitude and capacity to continue to lead Africa’s most populous country. “President Muhammadu Buhari has now shown neither the capacity nor the aptitude for the highest office in the land,” Ezekwesili said on Monday at a press conference in Lagos as her party unveiled its road-map for winning the 2019 presidential elections. “Let us talk about the present administration; what is the primary legacy of President Muhammadu Buhari? It is the destruction of our nation’s wealth — presiding over the worse economic recession Nigeria has seen in decades. “Even now that the economy has come out of recession, the growth is as sluggish as its government. Four out of every 10 adults are either unemployed or underemployed and Nigeria is now the poverty capital of the world,” she added. The APCN presidential candidate accused Buhari of being the “most nepotistic and most partisan president that Nigeria has ever seen” and said that the president who rode on the promises to fight corruption in 2015 is also “corrupt”  “This president talks about fighting grand corruption. Please, please, give me a break! Can corruption fight corruption? Does he think we cannot see?” Ezekwesili said The Presidential hopeful, who was the minister of education under the People’s Democratic party-led administration, said the opposition party is not also a better alternative to move Nigeria forward. “I just laugh when I hear some people say our citizen’s movement will split opposition votes. But the PDP is not in opposition to the APC. The candidate of the PDP has over the past 14 years gone from PDP to AC, AC to PDP, PDP to APC and now back to PDP” Ezekwesili said Ezekwesili also took a swipe at Buhari and PDP’s presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar, noting that if she eventually becomes the Nigerian president, “you will never hear any world leader call me lifeless or dishonest.” “I have no issues obtaining visas or travelling to any country in the world – whether it is the United States of America or the United Arab Emirates,” she said in a not-so-veiled reference to the PDP presidential candidate.  Recently, Financial Times reported that the United States president Donald Trump referred to Buhari as “lifeless” shortly after a meeting between the two leaders in April. The PDP presidential candidate, on his part, is rumoured to be avoiding travelling to the United States because of a pending indictment. The former minister of education, while stating her achievement in office, said she “introduced Public Private Partnership models for education service delivery and very importantly ensured that Innovation & Vocational Enterprise Institutions were accredited, certified and regulated by the National Board for Technical Education.” Ezekwesili, therefore, affirmed that the ruling party and opposition party are “brothers and sisters of iniquity and impoverishment, merchants of failure and disappointment.”"
"‘Politics is the art of the impossible, made possible’",https://guardian.ng/guardian-woman/politics-is-the-art-of-the-impossible-made-possible/,"Otto Von Bismarck once said, “Politics is the art of the possible, the attainable – the art of the next best.” Some qualify that it is also the art of the impossible. Indeed, anything is possible, as seen by the huge shake-up in African Gender Politics this month, most recently this week with Ethiopia electing its first female President, not to mention Prime Minister Aby Ahmed appointing new female ministers and enabling the country to be the first African country with 50 per cent female ministers. Then earlier there was the unprecedented candidacy announcement of Oby Ezekwesili, who’s campaigning as “the anti-establishment candidate,” and labelled by the ACPN as the “hope” candidate, in a similar fashion to Obama, back in 2008. Sadly, Nigeria is ranked far lower than nations such as South Africa, Rwanda, Uganda, Zambia and Mauritania and most recently Ethiopia among countries that encourage women to engage in politics. Rwanda with its parliament being top in the world in female representation at over 60 per cent deliberately increased women in decision-making roles and the country is progressing well economically, despite its recent dark and genocidal past. Perhaps the presence of women will in itself prevent the country from ever repeating its atrocious history. Where African politics is concerned, we are often looking at impossible situations that need to be changed, and in many parts of Nigeria, that’s the case. But how can we expect change, without getting down to the crux of these matters? Meaning, community level politics, where locals can get together and discuss and decide what their needs are. There is too much power politics in Nigeria; it’s more about power rather than policy change up top. We need the balance of a bottom-up approach, and this is where we need women to get more involved. Mothers, the people concerned about the wellbeing of their families, having access to healthcare, getting their kids to school… Women’s approach to politics is usually less about power and more about trying to solve social problems. Of course there are exceptions to this rule but women tend to try to solve community level issues, and not just women’s issues. Some may doubt the electoral power of Ms Ezekwesili, but she’s well-known for leading the #BringBackOurGirls campaign, a former education minister and a former Vice President of the World Bank’s Africa division and she’s setting a great example. When it comes to politics, women generally want to get involved in social matters worldwide and there are more female celebrities becoming ambassadors to international organisations and travelling down to communities to “mother” them, be it for a short and temporary while. Because this is what women are good at. So, wake up, ladies of Nigeria. If you don’t get involved, nothing is going to change. Politics is the art of the impossible, made possible. Let’s turn our impossible situations into possible solutions. Nigeria, we have a lot of catching up to do. We women also have to help ourselves. I believe Nigeria will accept more women bringing more to the table, but we have to engage ourselves. The men are not going to force us to do so. Former president Olusegun Obasanjo has hailed female politicians as being more “trustworthy” and recently pointed out that “no nation will become great when half of her population ends up only in the kitchen and ‘the other room’, or get disproportionately discriminated against in the higher echelons of corporate management and in governance.”

Human rights and post-2019 presidency,https://guardian.ng/opinion/human-rights-and-post-2019-presidency/,"At the weekend, I got into a very lengthy conversation with my younger brother currently based abroad and who left Nigeria when his life became endangered by open threats made by some Islamists responsible for the spate of violent attacks targeting largely Christian communities in the North of Nigeria. Our conversations centred around the deteriorated security situations not just in Nigeria but in a lot of regional neighbouring communities making up the West African nations otherwise known as Economic Community of West African States.  There is also no doubt that Nigeria is the epicenter of the expanding frontiers of Islamic terrorism. But what really triggered this mutual but frank dialogue was the emergence on Sunday noon of the erstwhile vice president Alhaji Abubakar Atiku as the official standard bearer of the largest opposition political party in the sub-Saharan African region – the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Other notable Nigerians who are flying the presidential flags of some of the newly registered political parties include the former Vice President of the World’s Bank and erstwhile Education minister, Mrs. Oby Ezekwesili; former Deputy Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria and a Professor of Economics in a U.S. based university, Dr. Kingsley Moghalu and the former governor of Cross Rivets State, Mr. Donald Duke.  Emeka, my very brilliant younger sibling is a philosopher by academic qualification and an illustrious human rights practitioner.  He is one of the intellectuals backing and participating actively and constructively in the agitations for self-determination in Nigeria of the Igbo nationality as coordinated by a completely peace loving and unarmed group of human rights activists – Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB). In addition to threats of death from government agents involved in the enforced disappearances of reputable opponents of the political status quo in Nigeria, Nigeria has become polarized alongside ethno religious fault lines.  This highly cerebral philosopher brother of mine was basically concerned about the re-emergence as president for a second tenure of one of Nigeria’s most divisive and bigoted political leaders – the retired Army General Muhammadu Buhari in the year 2019 general elections. Put differently, Emeka asked to know the post-2019 human right agenda of the President who would emerge if a transparent election is conducted. His question is how the Nigerian people can basically safeguard the sanctity of the forthcoming election given the notoriety displayed by the central electoral governing and management council known in law as the Independent National Electoral Commission. His anxiety about the lack of credibility of the current head of the independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) is also shared by millions of Nigerians who watched with considerable trepidation as the electoral umpire rigged the recently held Osun State governorship poll. Two United States senators, Chris Coons (D-Del.) and Cory Booker (D-N.J.), both members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, have raised concerns about the credibility of elections in Nigeria following allegations of political interference in the latest governorship polls. Coons and Booker said in a joint statement that though the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) had been commended by observers for its conduct of the recent polls, concerns remained about the prospects of free and fair elections in the country. The statement read, “As members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, we are troubled by reports of incidents of political interference and intimidation of voters, journalists, and civil society observers in Nigeria by some security agencies and political party supporters. Nigeria is Africa’s largest economy and a key U.S. partner on the continent. “While domestic and international election observers have credited electoral authorities for their administration of elections thus far, we are concerned about the prospects for a free, fair and credible democratic process in Nigeria in light of recent interference by government security forces on peaceful assembly and freedom of expression, as well as ongoing security threats and communal tensions in several regions of the country. “General elections in February 2019 will be an important step for Nigeria to consolidate democratic gains achieved in the last two decades since the transition from military to civilian democratic rule. We are watching the parties’ primaries with interest, and we call on party leaders, electoral authorities, security officials, and all Nigerians to respect the political process and safeguard free, fair, credible, and peaceful elections that reflect the will of the people.” Recall that governorship elections were held on September 22 in Osun State and won by the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) after initially being declared inconclusive by INEC after PDP led. After the voting on September 22, the candidate of the main opposition party, Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Senator Ademola Adeleke, had won the majority of votes. He was followed by the APC candidate, Gboyega Oyetola. But INEC declared the election inconclusive and conducted a rerun on September 27. After adding up the votes, Oyetola was declared winner by INEC. The failure to declare PDP the winner is extra constitutional because the constitution says simple majority is the deciding factor for electoral victory in that category. INEC had also awarded the APC victory in an earlier controversial governorship poll in Ekiti State on July14. In both elections, PDP and other opposition elements alleged foul play and interference by the ruling APC. The worries expressed by these two United States’ parliamentarians cuts across the feelings of millions of Nigerians who have similar sentiments that there is no assurance that the electoral panel will be transparent and ready to conduct a free, fair, peaceful and transparent general elections come 2019. As observed by these Americans, the interferences into the election come majorly from the security forces. The apprehensions that the current heads of the internal security team will compromise the election finds supports in the fact that almost all the current heads of the different armed security institutions owed their unmerited retention to the current president who is desperate for a second tenure. There is therefore the imperative demand that the fuller intents of Section 158 (1) of the constitution is respected which means that whatever measures that are needed to be enforced to guarantee independence of the electoral commission should be put in place. Whereas the fundamental concern of my younger brother was on who is best suited to restore national stability and the security of lives and property of Nigerians, it is as clear as the early morning sunrise that the Buhari–led administration has failed in the discharge of the primary duty of government. The primary duty of government as enshrined in Section 14 (2) (b) of the constitution is as follows: “The security and welfare of the people shall be the primary purpose of government.” It is a fact that hundreds-of-thousands of Nigerians have left the shores of Nigerian since the emergence of the current government just as those who had earlier left due to security threats have found concrete, genuine, verifiable reasons to remain where they are or risks their lives by returning at this material time. In Benue State alone, more than 1,500 persons have been killed in the last three years due to the bloody insurgency of armed Fulani herdsmen who enjoy the protection of the current administration. Plateau state has been in turmoil due largely to the violent insurgency of armed Fulani herdsmen. Southern Kaduna and Nasarawa neighbouring Abuja has had their shares of these murderous and targeted killings of Christians.  Both in words and action, key functionaries of the current government have clearly backed the activities of the armed Fulani gangsters.  The minister of Defence was quoted as blaming the anti-open grazing laws in Benue State for the bloody attacks by Fulani herdsmen. Dan-Ali the Fulani born minister of Defence had told state house reporters that the blockage of cattle routes across the country is the remote cause of the killings by herdsmen. “Whatever crisis that happens at anytime, there are remote and immediate causes. Look at this issue (killings in Benue and Taraba) what is the remote cause of the farmers’ crisis? Since the nation’s independence, we know there used to be a route whereby the cattle rearers take because they are all over the nation. If you go to Bayelsa or Ogun, you will see them. If those routes are blocked, what do you expect will happen? These people are Nigerians. It is just like one going to block the shoreline; does that make sense to you? But the immediate cause is the grazing law.” Mansur Dan-Ali, in the aforementioned thoughtless statement has demonstrated the callous insensitivity of the Buhari’s administration to the violence unleashed on Nigerians by armed Fulani herdsmen.  This also shows why the major organisation backing the Fulani herdsmen known as Miyetti Allah Cattle Owners Association, has yet to be declared a terrorist group even when they back the killings.
To be continued on tomorrow.

Oby Ezekwesili: Nobility In Service,https://guardian.ng/life/oby-ezekwesili-nobility-in-service/," Obiageli Ezekwesili was born in 1963. Ezekwesili holds a master’s degree in International Law and Diplomacy from the University of Lagos, and a Master of Public Administration degree from the Kennedy School of Government, Harvard University.  Before she obeyed the national clarion call, she worked as a chartered accountant in Deloitte and Touche and at the Center for International Development, Harvard. Her stint with the government began with her appointment as the first head of the Budget Monitoring and Price Intelligence Unit (popularly known as Due Process Unit). During her time, she was credited with changing and cleansing the method of public procurement or contracting at the Federal level in Nigeria.
In June 2005, she was appointed the Minister of Solid Minerals (Mines and Steel) and again, she kicked off a reform programme that put Nigeria on the global platform as a mining investment destination.  A year later, she became the Federal Minister of Education and in March 2007, she was appointed her Vice president of World Bank Africa region.
The co-founder of Transparency International (TI) has been named in BBC’s 100 Women, Time 100 Most Influential People, New York Times 25 Women of Impact for 2015, Albert Einstein’s Foundation’s Genius:100 Visions of the Future. In 2014, she became a co-convener of the #BringBackOurGirls campaign, the campaign addressed the kidnap of the 300 Chibok girls which received global recognition.
Owing to her achievements and her “fight against corruption”, she was nominated a recipient of the 2018 Nobel Peace Prize. The Peace Research Institute Oslo (PRIO) director Henrik Urdal described as her “an international champion in the fight against corruption… Chairperson of the Nigeria Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (NEITI), leading the first-ever national implementation of the global EITI standards.”"
Ezekwesili picks Gani Galadima as running mate,https://guardian.ng/news/ezekwesili-picks-gani-galadima-as-running-mate/,"The presidential candidate of the Allied Congress Party of Nigeria (ACPN), Oby Ezekwesili, has picked Abdulganiy Galadima as her running mate for the 2019 presidential election. This was disclosed on Wednesday in Ilorin when the presidential hopeful unveiled her full manifesto themed #ProjectRescueNigeria Galadinma, while reacting to the announcement thanked Ezekweili for her confidence for giving him a very tasking mission to be embarked upon. “As your vice presidential candidate, I want to tell you, your excellency, that I will work with you,” Galadinma said. “I will work with you to go deep down to the grassroots, to move to the length and breadth of the country trying to see to the Nigerian people,” he added."
Oby Ezekwesili: For The Love Of Nigeria,https://guardian.ng/life/oby-ezekwesili-for-the-love-of-nigeria/," Oby Ezekwesili is in the race to dislodge faltering Nigeria’s President Muhammadu Buhari. But a year ago, upending the political status quo in Africa’s most populous nation was, perhaps, only a residual thought; not something she would have loved. Twice a minister, first for education and later solid minerals under President Olusegun Obasanjo, Ezekwesili is not alien to the workings of the government. Her effort to make government procurement processes accountable and transparent as the pioneer head of the Budget Monitoring and Price Intelligence Unit earned her the nickname Madam Due Process. Her penchant for wanting things done the right way was recently acknowledged by a former president of Malawi Dr Joyce Banda. Banda describes how Ezekwesili’s counsel helped her in fighting corruption in her country. “While fighting corruption during my Presidency in 2013, @obyezeks advised me to protect myself with a forensic audit, which UK gov supported. I am forever grateful for this transparent, accountable daughter of Africa, a servant leader pushing for a better Nigeria,” Banda tweeted on November 20. Oby Ezekwesili For someone who was once a minister, an appointment, which is usually a product of political affiliation and patronage, her hatred for politics can be blamed on the rot in Nigeria’s political system. “I never had interest in politics. Anyone who knows me knows that I detest politics,” she says. “But I had to get to the place where listening to the political class say to us that we have to choose the lesser of two evils got me infuriated.” One important driving force behind her decision to cast aside her hatred for politics is the way the human lives have been cheapened since the advent of President Muhammadu Buhari’s administration. Buhari defeated the then incumbent Goodluck Jonathan in Nigeria’s general elections after campaigning to fight corruption, reposition the economy and strengthen internal security, especially in the Northeast. Ezekwesili agrees that Buhari can be given a “little bit of score” for what he has done in the strife-torn region, but insists that a government that allowed Nigeria’s economy to tank on the “back of oil shock” and wrong policy choices should not be allowed to lead the country beyond May 29, 2019. Beyond the downward spiral of the economy which has seen the unemployment rate rise to 18.80 in Q3 2017 when the last job figures were released, Ezekwesili is miffed by the spate of violence across the country and a biased anti-graft war. “This is a Nigeria under President Muhammadu Buhari where the primacy of the human life has been completely devalued…life is cheapened,” she says. “The lives of Nigerians today are not any better because President Buhari became our president. As a matter of fact, the quality of lives has taken a significant beaten.” Her misgiving about Buhari’s handling of the economy preceded her dream of being the president of Nigeria. In 2016, she lampooned the government’s “command and control” economic policies while faulting the intention of the President Buhari to protect the poor. “The president comes into this economic philosophy on the premise that he does not want the poor to suffer. I can relate to that, a leader must not allow the poor to suffer, especially a leader who knows that most of his votes came not from the elite but from the poor,” she said at The Platform, a public policy forum, in April 2016. “The problem though is that the intention and the outcome are diverged.” Obviously, her patience to continue to “relate” to such “archaic” policies ran out. Oby Ezekwesili While Ezekwesili has her mind firmly set on dethroning Buhari when the country goes to poll in the first quarter of 2019, she has to contend with a political culture that is both anti-woman and excessively moneyed. The odds are staggering. But she insists that the “fight” for “a new independence from our rapacious ruling class” is winnable. She is very much convinced that she represents millions of Nigerians who are disenchanted by years of failure of the current and past administrations. “I am not running alone,” she says with a definite conviction. “We are all running. This contest is between the political class that has failed over and over against the Nigerian people and the Nigerian people.” But in a country where the voting public is easily ingratiated by quick and fleeting political favours and an entrenched political culture that has done little to curb electoral malpractices, how she will able to best her opponents is yet to be seen. It is impossible that Ezekwesili is unaware of these odds. Yet, she brims with the hope that her dream of repositioning Nigeria for a greater good will be realised. “I am the candidate of the people,” she remarks. Oby Ezekwesili Ezekwesili is not exactly new to facing down challenges. Her activism preceded the kidnapping of the Chibok girls in 2014. She was a member and the first female leader of The Concerned Professionals Citizens Movement. The group campaigned for Nigeria’s return to democracy in the 1990s. In recent years, she has been one of the most consistent voices against misrule and the excesses of the Nigerian political class. When the Chibok Girls were kidnapped from their schools in April 2014, she became a vocal advocate for their quick rescue. #BringBackOurGirls, a movement which she co-founded adopted a number of approaches -including sits-out and marches – to pressure the then President Goodluck Jonathan to act fast rescuing of the girls. Loyalists of the sitting Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) government accused her of being a paid agent. That led into her passport being briefly seized by the agents of the state when she was travelling to London in July 2014. When power changed hands in May 2015, Nigerians hoped the new government would introduce a new system of doing things. And for Ezekwesili, her travails in the hands of the government took a drastic turn. In January, she and seven other members of the BBOG movement were arrested and detained by police while protesting for the release for the Chibok Girls. In June, her one-man march on the Nigerian State House, Abuja to protest the killings of 100 persons by suspected herdsmen in Plateau communities in June was halted by security operatives. Again, she has been at the receiving end of attacks from loyalists of the current All Progressives Congress (APC), who felt her criticism of the Buhari administration was one too many, and from agents of the PDP, who thought she was beyond being forgiven for allegedly contributing to the party’s losses at the polls in 2015. But Ezekwesili insists her advocacy for the girl child and the woman will not take a back seat in spite of her personal dream of rescuing Nigeria from the grips APC and PDP. “Chibok girls, Leah Sharibu…will permanently remain the basis of my advocacy,” she tells Guardian Life. “The advocacy that we have done concerning Chibok girls and Leah Sharibu is one that is endless. It is never going to come to an end until those girls are back.” And there is always family and friends
Left to her husband, Chinedu Ezekwesili, she would have been into active politics much earlier. He has first-hand experience about how passionate she is about solving Nigeria’s problems. And when she eventually told him that she was going to contest the presidency, there was a eureka moment. “‘Finally, my baby is ready,’ he told me when I told him,” she says. Her three sons, on the other hand, were a bit worried. But they all gave their support to her aspirations. “Our children…they know how totally committed to Nigeria I am. Even though they worry, but on the aggregate, the whole idea is, ‘Mum, go ahead and do this.’” Ezekwesili firmly believes in a family creating a culture that works for its members, without anyone being unduly disadvantaged. “Every family where people act together don’t have to debate who does what,” she says. For anyone to be a functional member of a society, she says, possession of “all the [necessary] skills is important."
Oby Ezekwesili: Running Against Corruption,https://guardian.ng/life/oby-ezekwesili-running-against-corruption/," Since her entry into active politics, Oby Ezekwesili has become one of Nigeria’s mouthpiece. Unlike the characteristic nature of Nigerian public office holders of going into oblivion after serving, Ezekwesili has remained undaunted in ensuring that Nigeria is the country she dreams of. From her times as Madam Due Process because of her radical and transparent approach to eradicating all forms of damaging practices in the government procurement process to giving counsels that is used in different countries administrations to tackle corruption, there is no doubt that the former vice president of the World Bank for Africa is ready for the role as the country’s first position. With her campaign running, she says she never had an interest in politics…”But I had to get to the place where listening to the political class say to us that we have to choose the lesser of two evils got me infuriated,” she told Guardian Life. Speaking on the Bring Back Our Girls Campaign, a committed cause she is known for, she tells Guardian Life her experience including her one-man march. “This is a Nigeria under President Muhammadu Buhari where the primacy of the human life has been completely devalued…life is cheapened,” she says. Ezekwesili is also miffed by the spate of violence across the country and a biased anti-graft war.

"Buhari’s anti-graft war unspectacular, says Ezekwesili",https://guardian.ng/news/buharis-anti-graft-war-unspectacular-says-ezekwesili/,"Presidential aspirant, Oby Ezekwesili, on Wednesday, said that President Muhammadu Buhari has not done any spectacular work in his fight against corruption. While he was campaigning for presidency in 2015, Buhari’s manifesto was hinged on rebuilding the economy, a  strong anti-corruption war and a fight against insurgency. Buhari won at the presidential polls ahead of the then incumbent President Goodluck Jonathan, whose tenure had been riddled with allegations of grand scale corruption affecting even the fight against insurgents. However, three years into his tenure and months before the next general elections, the President, seeking re-election, has been accused of fighting a selective anti-corruption war. The Allied Congress for Progressives Change candidate said the anti-graft agencies including the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) are being used by the president to pick on members of opposition parties. “On corruption, President Buhari has not done any spectacular work,” Ezekwesili told Guardian TV. “What he has done is reduce the fight against corruption to a tunnel vision of EFCC hunting down those who have not joined the APC,” Ezekwesili said. “We are saying that fighting corruption is a comprehensive approach that looks at reducing opportunities of corruption through the kind of structural changes and systemic changes and policies that change the way that governments acts in an economy. “President Buhari has lived below the expectation of the integrity that he told us was his significant point or selling point on the basis of which Nigerians elected him.” Ezekwesili, who plans to unseat Buhari at the 2019 polls, insisted that Nigerians do not have to choose between two evils or choose the lesser evil. “Nigeria needs to be rescued from the entrenched system of politics that is a cyclical pattern of failure. We cannot be choosing any evil. We don’t need evil to fix the conditions that we have found ourselves. We need the right sets of thoughts in development. We need people with character, competence and capacity, who lead not for themselves but for the society,” she said. “I want to be that person that challenges this very artificial construct that Nigeria cannot amount to any good. We can fight and get Nigeria to that place of promise that it belongs.” The Bring Back our Girls convener noted that while there have been gains in the war against insurgency in the North east of Nigeria, the government still hasn’t taken Nigerians to the promised land. “The North east that was mostly occupied by the terrorist is not occupied to that extent. But people have not been able to all return to their neighbourhoods and communities. Lives have not been restored, we still have millions of our people in IDP camps,” Ezekwesili said. “This is the Nigeria under the President Muhammadu Buhari where the primacy of the human life has completely been devalued. Life is cheapened.” She also lamented the poor economic policies of the current government that has led the nation to be named the poverty capital by the World Poverty Clock. “The economy that was on an average growth of 5-6% was allowed to tank on the back of oil shock, but mostly because of very very wrong policy choices. the economic policy choices of the administration has put the economy in dire straits and that is something that we must fight. “The lives of Nigerians are not today any better because President Buhari became our president. The primacy of the human life has taken a significant beating.”"
Personal attacks as nature of presidential campaigns to come,https://guardian.ng/politics/personal-attacks-as-nature-of-presidential-campaigns-to-come/,"As the 2019 presidential election draws nearer, there are indications that the campaign would be characterised by personal attacks and brickbat. Already, opponents of President Mohammadu Buhari are pointing at loopholes in virtually all policies of his All Progressives Congress (APC) government. But what seems to be lacking is clear identification of the lapses and solutions to them. Prominent among the critics in recent time is the candidate of the Allied Congress Party of Nigeria (ACPN), Dr. Oby Ezekwesili. The one-time vice president of World Bank has on every available platform condemned the candidates of both Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and All Progressives Congress (APC), describing them as incompetent and corrupt. She maintained that the emergence of both Atiku Abubakar (PDP) and Mohammadu Buhari (APC) would amount to recycling of ‘political fraudsters’, which has slowed down the economic growth of the country. However, many Nigerians, think that the battle for Aso-Rock Villa is between the two vilified candidates (Buhari and Atiku), given their wide range of experience, political sagacity, structure and financial stamina to woo voters. Ezekwesili thinks otherwise, insisting that such opinion is only for the ignorant, and ought to fade off in the polity. According to her, the thought that some people are in control of some parts of the country, and so, will influence the election, is totally false. Citing example, she noted that the National Leader of APC, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu’s political strength is grossly overrated. Specifically, she noted that Tinubu, who most people think controls Lagos State, does not have control of Alimosho, the largest council area in the state, adding the he was only able to deliver 86,897 votes out of the 650,000 registered voters in Alimosho in the last presidential election. “Tinubu is believed to wield much power in the South-West. He worked for the election of President Muhammadu Buhari in 2015. Tinubu and his like in #APCPDP control only as much as we let them. Alimosho, for example, is the largest council area in Lagos State, with over 1.2 million residents, according to official census figures. In 2015, only about 650,000 of these people registered and obtained their Permanent Voters Cards (PVCs).” She added that it was because the people were faced with the unattractive choice of voting for PDP’s Goodluck Jonathan, or the anyone-but-Jonathan candidacy represented by Muhammadu Buhari, a great many voters chose to abstain from 2015 election. “At the end of the day, they only managed to conjure up 140,000 votes between them, in almighty Alimosho. This says something loud and clear that Tinubu, with all of his ‘might’ and experience in so-called grassroots politics, could, at the end of the day, deliver only 86,897 votes for his candidate Buhari and their party. Where then does the source of this his widely reported power come from? Isn’t he grossly overestimated?” ‘Butiku’
Ezekwesili, in skepticism, described the two parties as Siamese Twins that could not be separated by any doctor. She maintained that for those who have been saying that the 2019 election is anyone but Buhari would be surprised as they would be forced to sing the same song of anyone but Atiku in 2023. She maintained that both parties are not two but a single party fielding one single candidate, “and that candidate’s name is BuTiku. Yes, you heard me right, BuTiku.” She noted that any attempt to choose between the two is like asking somebody to choose between death by poison or death by gunshot. “God forbid. We cannot reject one oppressor and hand over to another. We do not love bondage. We do not enjoy suffering. God in heaven forbid. “I just laugh when I hear some people say our citizens movement will split opposition votes. But the PDP is not in opposition to the APC. The candidate of the PDP has over the past 14 years gone from PDP to AC, AC to PDP, PDP to APC and now back to PDP. These people are brothers and sisters of iniquity and impoverishment, merchants of failure and disappointment. Don’t believe that 419! They are both part of a political ruling class that has held us bound, manipulated and diminished us for decades. “Now they are auditioning to extend their streak of failure for another four years? God really forbid! The real opponent that the Nigerian people have in 2019 is this old political order that takes and takes and takes, and never replenishes anything.” ‘Obytiku’s visit’
Following Ezekwesili’s meeting with one of Nigeria’s former military rulers, Ibrahim Babangida, at his residence in Minna, Niger State, a lot of criticisms from Nigerians have assailed that visit, prominent among the critic is the presidential candidate of African Action Congress (AAC), Omoyele Sowore. Recall that Ezekwesili has been a critique of all previous governments in the country but on Monday, Ezekwesili tweeted that she met with Babangida to discuss how Nigeria must be taken out of the clutches of the old order in 2019. “I had a very candid conversation with former head of state, Ibrahim Babangida, in Minna after my speech on Human Capital Development at El Amin School. I made it clear that Nigeria must be taken out of the clutches of the Old Order. This is our mission,” she tweeted. Reacting to this, Sowore maintained that her meeting with the former military ruler should not have held. “Our dear Ezekwesili wants to stop corruption and mis-governance in Nigeria but then holds a secret session with the Godfather of corruption and bad governance, IBB. Nigerians, Ezekwesili creatively coined BUTIKU. I love it! But this single visit is OBYTIKU.” Ezekwesili warned against derogatory campaign
However, a group of Atiku’s supporters, under the aegis of Atiku for Better Nigeria, has warned Ezekwesili to desist from using derogatory remarks against Atiku and the Peoples Democratic Party, advising her to concentrate on her campaign and stop tagging other contestants and political parties as fraudsters. The group, in a statement by its National Coordinator, Benita Dike-Israel, advised Ezekwesili to learn the ropes in politics so as to avoid “falling into the abyss”. They argued that by painting Atiku and the PDP black, Ezekwesili was indicting herself and biting the fingers that fed her since she was a minister under the PDP regime. “Ezekwesili should learn not to be rude to Atiku or bite the fingers that fed her. For her to say that the PDP and Atiku lack knowledge in economy and (are) into 419 politics is self-indicting. That means her period, as Minister of Education and Solid Minerals added no value to the party that appointed her and to Nigeria as a whole; that also means that her immense credential amounts to naught and (she) has nothing new to offer. After all, a river is as good as its source; for whatever is built on void is void.” The Atiku supporters argued that by joining politics, Ezekwesili, who had been spearheading the campaign for the release of the abducted Chibok schoolgirls through the #BringBackOurGirls movement, had “diluted her fame and goodwill among ordinary Nigerians and friends of Nigeria.” According to the group, people will now begin to see Ezekwesili’s campaign for the release of the Chibok schoolgirls as “a mere ruse, smokescreen and cheap opportunity to feather her own political nest. Whereas it is her constitutional right as an eligible Nigerian to contest the election, yet she should understand politics as a game of persuasion and lobbying rather than (using) pressure group tactics of brick batting and (using) foul language. She can politicise without being rude and judgmental.”

Revisiting the Air Nigeria project,https://guardian.ng/opinion/revisiting-the-air-nigeria-project/,"Sir: When on July 18, 2018 Hadi Sirika, the Minister of State for Aviation, told a large audience, including aviation experts during a diplomatic trip to the United Kingdom of Nigeria preparedness to float Nigeria Air, many were ecstatic about the project. He said, the project was aimed at resurrecting the defunct Nigeria Airways. The project was said to bring about innovation in the Aviation sector of the country. It therefore, came as a quaking bombshell, when it was announced that the proposed project has been put on hold. One continues to wonder if the motive behind the project was well thought-out and planned, as the sudden suspension clearly portrays a wrong approach and perhaps wasteful decision.  Or how do you explain that a project supposedly well planned and driven actively was put on hold due to alleged investors’ apathy? It would be recalled that on July 18, 2018 at the Farnborough international Airshow in the UK, the Nigerian minister of state for aviation announced that the erstwhile Nigeria Airways will be making a return to the skies as Nigeria Air. The minister said the Nigerian government will inject 8.8 million dollars into Nigeria Air as viability gap funding. He said the private sector investors will bring some 300 million dollars as start-up capital.  Obviously, it was shocking when the public got to know that Nigerian Air may not fly for now. Perhaps the project would have continued if only communication was efficient or if knowledgeable Nigerians had been involved rather than the snippets dropped here and there by those in charge. Even the views of the Nigerian air operators were waved off as the experts foresaw loopholes in floating a National airline from scratch, when there were still many deficits on the act. One of the notable Nigerians who spoke against the investment was Oby Ezekwesili, the former minister of Education, who faulted the plan and financial implication of Nigerian Air. The decay of Nigeria Airways commenced in 2003, when planes became flying coffins due to substandard purchase of Aircraft. The Aviation industry has witnessed several losses of lives and property worth billions. Transportation by air became a risk to the masses, everything that could go wrong with the aviation sector did go wrong from the disengagement and payoff of the former staff still pending to the aborted or better still pending project of Nigeria Air. The project will continually be hollow and a mere drain pipe on the public fund at the expense of the Nigerian tax payer as long as the problem in the Air sector is not checked. Having a newly birthed Nigeria Air is a good and welcome development. However, it would have to go beyond Sirika’s optimism and nice words to become an achievable dream.  There must be a renewed commitment from the government and private sector players to see Nigeria Air work out, as Nigeria is a sleeping giant that has been stirred from sleep. The aviation sector is one of the sectors in the country’s economy that can shake up this giant to consciousness if well harnessed and utilised. Therefore, investors with sincere motives should be bought into plan. Also, there should be an agreed plan of such intended and magnificent project just as the place of private public partnership remains valid for this kind of idea. Furthermore, Air Nigeria should go beyond some set of political individuals. We have experts who are Nigerians and will be willing to be part of the think-thank on the initiative and this should be explored totally. Nevertheless, there should be political will to have Air Nigeria rather than vote appeal intention. A laudable project such as Air Nigeria is strategic to the economic growth of the nation and aviation sector. Government should endeavour to resuscitate it. It must not be allowed to die.

"Buhari’s government is corrupt, says Ezekwesili",https://guardian.ng/politics/buharis-government-is-corrupt-says-ezekwesili/,"A speech by Obiageli  ‘Oby’ Ezekwesili, presidential candidate of the Allied Congress Party of Nigeria at a World Press Conference on Monday, October 29, 2018 in Lagos. How can they say that we are finished?
We have just begun.
We have nowhere else to run to.
We have nowhere else to go. Ladies and gentlemen, you are welcome to this conference. When the singer TY Bello released that powerful anthem in 2011, Nigerians were on the march to a historic election. It was an election that showed us a vision of what is possible in our country – that the son of a humble fisherman from a minority tribe in the Niger Delta can rise to become president of the federal republic of Nigeria.The winner of that presidential election described his victory as “the renewal of hope” in Nigeria. And most Nigerians believed him.Until a series of own goals crashed that hope down a slippery slope, and that beautiful Nigerian dream tragically became a nightmare. In 2015, Nigerians were on the march again.
Citizens were so angry with the brand of failure posing as governance that we took a gamble and placed their hopes in today’s ruling party, the APC and President Muhammadu Buhari, a 71-year old former dictator who has now shown neither the capacity nor the aptitude for the highest office in the land. If that campaign was a movie, the title of the movie would be: “The lesser of two evils.”Everything the APC candidate did was justified and excused because he was branded as “the lesser evil.” He was given an easy ride. No serious questions were asked about his competence or track record or world view; he couldn’t even be bothered to attend a presidential debate to defend his ideas in a competitive environment. Yet he was promising CHANGE. And a majority of Nigerian voters bought what he was selling. But where is this change?
I intend to do three things here today:
First, I will lay bare what is at stake in this election by telling you why the failed PDP and its candidate, Atiku Abubakar, are not alternatives to the failed APC and its candidate, President Buhari. They are one and the same, siamese twins of failure and destruction.
Second, I will tell you why my candidacy under the Allied Congress Party of Nigeria (ACPN) represents the most prepared, most qualified and most formidable choice for 2019, and why you cannot afford to sit on the sidelines in this battle for the soul of Nigeria.Finally, I will address the most frequently repeated concerns about my candidacy and then what exactly we need to do to take this movement from here to Aso Rock. So let us look back briefly, to 2015
Do you remember? The chant all across the country was “Anyone But Jonathan.” Sadly, that is how we ended up with this reprobate government.
This time it is: “Anyone But Buhari.” And by that they mean that we should reinstate the failed PDP and its candidate, former vice president Atiku Abubakar because they think Atiku is the only person that can defeat Buhari in 2019. And in 2023, when Atiku and the PDP inevitably fail again, because a bad tree cannot bear good fruit? We will hear new chants of “Anyone But Atiku.”That is how we get looped in a cycle of insanity – repeating the same thing, and expecting a different result. That cycle of failure is unsustainable and it has to end NOW. 2019 cannot be “Anyone But Buhari”. Our country is not a recycling plant for uninspiring old men with their old ideas and old dubious characters. We deserve better than their aggressive mediocrity. And that is why I am running for president – to lead a people’s movement that will permanently terminate bad leadership, retire these incompetents and fight for every Nigerian. For those of you considering the PDP as an alternative, I really want to ask you: what is the thing that you see about them that is any different from the APC. Really? These people are the same: Siamese Twins of Failure.Fellow Nigerians, here is the truth of the matter: the APCPDP is not two parties. The #APCPDP is one single party fielding one single candidate, and that candidate’s name is #BuTiku. Yes, you heard me right – #BuTiku. Buhari and Atiku are conjoined from head to toe as #BuTiku. There is no lesser evil in #BuTiku. #BuTiku are members of the same party. Attempting to choose between these two is like asking one to choose between death by poison or death by gunshot. God forbid. We cannot reject one oppressor and hand over to another oppressor. We do not love bondage. We do not enjoy suffering. God in heaven forbid. I just laugh when I hear some people say our citizens movement will split opposition votes. But the PDP is not in opposition to the APC. The candidate of the PDP has over the past 14 years gone from PDP to AC, AC to PDP, PDP to APC and now back to PDP. These people are brothers and sisters of iniquity and impoverishment, merchants of failure and disappointment. Don’t believe that 419! They are both part of a political ruling class that has held us bound, manipulated and diminished us for decades. Now they are auditioning to extend their streak of failure for another four years? God really forbid! The real opponent that the Nigerian people have in 2019 is this old political order that takes and takes and takes, and never replenishes anything. I should know. I was headhunted from Harvard in 1999, asked to come and help as a technocrat to rebuild a country that had just been recovered from the wasted years of the military. I accepted, like many other brilliant Nigerian minds from home and abroad, and we worked together to bring due process into government, secure debt relief, open up our economy, rebuild institutions and attack poverty. The things I saw with in those days really fired me up to insist on due process, fellow Nigerians. Because for these terrible Nigerian politicians, corruption is all fun and games. These people have no desire but for more power, power, power, power. They stay up at night conspiring to steal and pillage, to loot and destroy. Oh, my brothers and sisters, I served in that government with one of the candidates who is running under #APCPDP in this election. Kai! No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Six and a half years after, in 2007, I had fought the fight that had to be fought from within, and then I left government knowing for sure that if this politicial order is not changed, the work of good governance that good people do within government will never last. I decided not to re-enter government, rebuffing every request made since, and instead made a decision to dedicate my life to activating citizens to push these blood-sucking political class out of office. I returned from the World Bank five years later to do just that, and the PDP was still at it! Same incentives, same behavior. The political class was completely unchanged – and had in fact become completely worse.For goodness sake, what has fundamentally changed about that PDP we have always known? What lessons did the party really learn after its defeat in 2015? Is this not the same PDP that looted the monies meant to equip our military, so that our soldiers had to run away at the sight of Boko Haram, because they had no weapons? The same PDP that spent precious days denying that our Chibok girls were kidnapped and so allowed the terrorists get away? Is this not the same PDP that conducted a recruitment exercise for the Immigration Service that killed scores of our young people and yet nobody was sacked or punished? Haba. How can we forget so easily! So the question is: Apart from forgetfulness, why are some Nigerians suddenly considering the PDP yet again? I have heard some people say it is because the PDP candidate has run successful businesses and therefore will be good for the economy at a time like this.That response just makes me shake my head in wonderment: Is it the same person we know, or are we speaking of another? Perhaps you never read a 2005 email from the president of Atiku’s university which was obtained by US investigators.Let me quote a small portion from that mail: “…The flow of revenue to the university will slow dramatically if Atiku’s political fortunes continue to wane… Construction delays on campus have also raised fears that the prospects for the university are linked to Atiku’s political success.”Did you just hear what that email said? That the success of that man’s private business is dependent on our commonwealth? And there was more!
A special report by a US Senate Committee on Foreign Corruption concluded that “over an eight-year period from 2000 to 2008, Atiku and his wife, Jennifer Douglas were able to bring over $40 million in suspect funds into the United States…”This was at the very time that this person was the Vice President of this very same country. And these are the people you want to put in charge of the national treasury? In charge of the money for your children’s education? Of the resources for our country’s hospitals? Of the budget for our depleted army and our impoverished police force? If we dive into all the filthy issues involving the PDP candidate – from the PTDF saga to the $2.8 million Siemens bribery scandal – we may spend the entire day here today and I simply do not have that time.So let us talk about the present administration, the evil twin.What is the primary legacy of President Muhammadu Buhari? It is the destruction of our nation’s wealth, presiding over the worst economic recession Nigeria has seen in decades. Even now that the economy has come out of recession, the growth is as sluggish as his government. 4 out of every 10 adults today are either unemployed or underemployed, and Nigeria is now the Poverty Capital of the World, the World Bank confirmining that we now have more extremely poor people than India which has a population six times our size.And in the midst of this, his Vice President was celebrating last week at the Nigeria Economic Summit that handing bailouts to state governors to pay salaries is an achievement.
What a big shame!"
"Nigerians will not choose between corruption and incompetence, Oby Ezekwesili insists",https://guardian.ng/news/nigerians-will-not-choose-between-corruption-and-incompetence-oby-ezekwesili-insists/,"Presidential candidate of the Allied Congress Party of Nigeria (ACPN), Oby Ezekwesili, has stated that Nigerians will not choose between incompetence and corruption in next year’s general elections. Describing President Muhammadu Buhari’s administration as incompetent and sluggish, she said former Vice President Abubakar Atiku was corrupt. Ezekwesili, who spoke at a media briefing in Lagos yesterday cautioned that if Nigerians repeat the mistake of 2015 by choosing a lesser evil next year, the country would suffer its consequences. She also said Vice President Yemi Osinbajo’s celebration of bailouts, as an achievement of the present administration is a colossal shame, adding that the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and All Progressives Congress (APC) are like Siamese twins of failure and destruction. “In 2015, the chant all across the country was ‘Anyone But Jonathan.’ Sadly, that is how we ended up with this reprobate government. This time it is: ‘Anyone But Buhari.’ “And by that they mean that we should reinstate the failed PDP and its candidate, because they think he is the only person that can defeat Buhari in 2019 and in 2023 when Atiku and PDP fail again, because a bad tree cannot bear good fruits.”"
"Buhari lacks aptitude to lead Nigeria, says Ezekwesili",https://guardian.ng/news/buhari-lacks-aptitude-to-lead-nigeria-says-ezekwesili/,"The presidential candidate of the Allied Congress Party of Nigeria (ACPN),Oby Ezekwesili said President Muhammadu Buhari lacks the aptitude and capacity to continue to lead Africa’s most populous country. “President Muhammadu Buhari has now shown neither the capacity nor the aptitude for the highest office in the land,” Ezekwesili said on Monday at a press conference in Lagos as her party unveiled its road-map for winning the 2019 presidential elections. “Let us talk about the present administration; what is the primary legacy of President Muhammadu Buhari? It is the destruction of our nation’s wealth — presiding over the worse economic recession Nigeria has seen in decades. “Even now that the economy has come out of recession, the growth is as sluggish as its government. Four out of every 10 adults are either unemployed or underemployed and Nigeria is now the poverty capital of the world,” she added. The APCN presidential candidate accused Buhari of being the “most nepotistic and most partisan president that Nigeria has ever seen” and said that the president who rode on the promises to fight corruption in 2015 is also “corrupt”  “This president talks about fighting grand corruption. Please, please, give me a break! Can corruption fight corruption? Does he think we cannot see?” Ezekwesili said The Presidential hopeful, who was the minister of education under the People’s Democratic party-led administration, said the opposition party is not also a better alternative to move Nigeria forward. “I just laugh when I hear some people say our citizen’s movement will split opposition votes. But the PDP is not in opposition to the APC. The candidate of the PDP has over the past 14 years gone from PDP to AC, AC to PDP, PDP to APC and now back to PDP” Ezekwesili said Ezekwesili also took a swipe at Buhari and PDP’s presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar, noting that if she eventually becomes the Nigerian president, “you will never hear any world leader call me lifeless or dishonest.” “I have no issues obtaining visas or travelling to any country in the world – whether it is the United States of America or the United Arab Emirates,” she said in a not-so-veiled reference to the PDP presidential candidate.  Recently, Financial Times reported that the United States president Donald Trump referred to Buhari as “lifeless” shortly after a meeting between the two leaders in April. The PDP presidential candidate, on his part, is rumoured to be avoiding travelling to the United States because of a pending indictment. The former minister of education, while stating her achievement in office, said she “introduced Public Private Partnership models for education service delivery and very importantly ensured that Innovation & Vocational Enterprise Institutions were accredited, certified and regulated by the National Board for Technical Education.” Ezekwesili, therefore, affirmed that the ruling party and opposition party are “brothers and sisters of iniquity and impoverishment, merchants of failure and disappointment.”"
"‘Politics is the art of the impossible, made possible’",https://guardian.ng/guardian-woman/politics-is-the-art-of-the-impossible-made-possible/,"Otto Von Bismarck once said, “Politics is the art of the possible, the attainable – the art of the next best.” Some qualify that it is also the art of the impossible. Indeed, anything is possible, as seen by the huge shake-up in African Gender Politics this month, most recently this week with Ethiopia electing its first female President, not to mention Prime Minister Aby Ahmed appointing new female ministers and enabling the country to be the first African country with 50 per cent female ministers. Then earlier there was the unprecedented candidacy announcement of Oby Ezekwesili, who’s campaigning as “the anti-establishment candidate,” and labelled by the ACPN as the “hope” candidate, in a similar fashion to Obama, back in 2008. Sadly, Nigeria is ranked far lower than nations such as South Africa, Rwanda, Uganda, Zambia and Mauritania and most recently Ethiopia among countries that encourage women to engage in politics. Rwanda with its parliament being top in the world in female representation at over 60 per cent deliberately increased women in decision-making roles and the country is progressing well economically, despite its recent dark and genocidal past. Perhaps the presence of women will in itself prevent the country from ever repeating its atrocious history. Where African politics is concerned, we are often looking at impossible situations that need to be changed, and in many parts of Nigeria, that’s the case. But how can we expect change, without getting down to the crux of these matters? Meaning, community level politics, where locals can get together and discuss and decide what their needs are. There is too much power politics in Nigeria; it’s more about power rather than policy change up top. We need the balance of a bottom-up approach, and this is where we need women to get more involved. Mothers, the people concerned about the wellbeing of their families, having access to healthcare, getting their kids to school… Women’s approach to politics is usually less about power and more about trying to solve social problems. Of course there are exceptions to this rule but women tend to try to solve community level issues, and not just women’s issues. Some may doubt the electoral power of Ms Ezekwesili, but she’s well-known for leading the #BringBackOurGirls campaign, a former education minister and a former Vice President of the World Bank’s Africa division and she’s setting a great example. When it comes to politics, women generally want to get involved in social matters worldwide and there are more female celebrities becoming ambassadors to international organisations and travelling down to communities to “mother” them, be it for a short and temporary while. Because this is what women are good at. So, wake up, ladies of Nigeria. If you don’t get involved, nothing is going to change. Politics is the art of the impossible, made possible. Let’s turn our impossible situations into possible solutions. Nigeria, we have a lot of catching up to do. We women also have to help ourselves. I believe Nigeria will accept more women bringing more to the table, but we have to engage ourselves. The men are not going to force us to do so. Former president Olusegun Obasanjo has hailed female politicians as being more “trustworthy” and recently pointed out that “no nation will become great when half of her population ends up only in the kitchen and ‘the other room’, or get disproportionately discriminated against in the higher echelons of corporate management and in governance.”

Human rights and post-2019 presidency,https://guardian.ng/opinion/human-rights-and-post-2019-presidency/,"At the weekend, I got into a very lengthy conversation with my younger brother currently based abroad and who left Nigeria when his life became endangered by open threats made by some Islamists responsible for the spate of violent attacks targeting largely Christian communities in the North of Nigeria. Our conversations centred around the deteriorated security situations not just in Nigeria but in a lot of regional neighbouring communities making up the West African nations otherwise known as Economic Community of West African States.  There is also no doubt that Nigeria is the epicenter of the expanding frontiers of Islamic terrorism. But what really triggered this mutual but frank dialogue was the emergence on Sunday noon of the erstwhile vice president Alhaji Abubakar Atiku as the official standard bearer of the largest opposition political party in the sub-Saharan African region – the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Other notable Nigerians who are flying the presidential flags of some of the newly registered political parties include the former Vice President of the World’s Bank and erstwhile Education minister, Mrs. Oby Ezekwesili; former Deputy Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria and a Professor of Economics in a U.S. based university, Dr. Kingsley Moghalu and the former governor of Cross Rivets State, Mr. Donald Duke.  Emeka, my very brilliant younger sibling is a philosopher by academic qualification and an illustrious human rights practitioner.  He is one of the intellectuals backing and participating actively and constructively in the agitations for self-determination in Nigeria of the Igbo nationality as coordinated by a completely peace loving and unarmed group of human rights activists – Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB). In addition to threats of death from government agents involved in the enforced disappearances of reputable opponents of the political status quo in Nigeria, Nigeria has become polarized alongside ethno religious fault lines.  This highly cerebral philosopher brother of mine was basically concerned about the re-emergence as president for a second tenure of one of Nigeria’s most divisive and bigoted political leaders – the retired Army General Muhammadu Buhari in the year 2019 general elections. Put differently, Emeka asked to know the post-2019 human right agenda of the President who would emerge if a transparent election is conducted. His question is how the Nigerian people can basically safeguard the sanctity of the forthcoming election given the notoriety displayed by the central electoral governing and management council known in law as the Independent National Electoral Commission. His anxiety about the lack of credibility of the current head of the independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) is also shared by millions of Nigerians who watched with considerable trepidation as the electoral umpire rigged the recently held Osun State governorship poll. Two United States senators, Chris Coons (D-Del.) and Cory Booker (D-N.J.), both members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, have raised concerns about the credibility of elections in Nigeria following allegations of political interference in the latest governorship polls. Coons and Booker said in a joint statement that though the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) had been commended by observers for its conduct of the recent polls, concerns remained about the prospects of free and fair elections in the country. The statement read, “As members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, we are troubled by reports of incidents of political interference and intimidation of voters, journalists, and civil society observers in Nigeria by some security agencies and political party supporters. Nigeria is Africa’s largest economy and a key U.S. partner on the continent. “While domestic and international election observers have credited electoral authorities for their administration of elections thus far, we are concerned about the prospects for a free, fair and credible democratic process in Nigeria in light of recent interference by government security forces on peaceful assembly and freedom of expression, as well as ongoing security threats and communal tensions in several regions of the country. “General elections in February 2019 will be an important step for Nigeria to consolidate democratic gains achieved in the last two decades since the transition from military to civilian democratic rule. We are watching the parties’ primaries with interest, and we call on party leaders, electoral authorities, security officials, and all Nigerians to respect the political process and safeguard free, fair, credible, and peaceful elections that reflect the will of the people.” Recall that governorship elections were held on September 22 in Osun State and won by the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) after initially being declared inconclusive by INEC after PDP led. After the voting on September 22, the candidate of the main opposition party, Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Senator Ademola Adeleke, had won the majority of votes. He was followed by the APC candidate, Gboyega Oyetola. But INEC declared the election inconclusive and conducted a rerun on September 27. After adding up the votes, Oyetola was declared winner by INEC. The failure to declare PDP the winner is extra constitutional because the constitution says simple majority is the deciding factor for electoral victory in that category. INEC had also awarded the APC victory in an earlier controversial governorship poll in Ekiti State on July14. In both elections, PDP and other opposition elements alleged foul play and interference by the ruling APC. The worries expressed by these two United States’ parliamentarians cuts across the feelings of millions of Nigerians who have similar sentiments that there is no assurance that the electoral panel will be transparent and ready to conduct a free, fair, peaceful and transparent general elections come 2019. As observed by these Americans, the interferences into the election come majorly from the security forces. The apprehensions that the current heads of the internal security team will compromise the election finds supports in the fact that almost all the current heads of the different armed security institutions owed their unmerited retention to the current president who is desperate for a second tenure. There is therefore the imperative demand that the fuller intents of Section 158 (1) of the constitution is respected which means that whatever measures that are needed to be enforced to guarantee independence of the electoral commission should be put in place. Whereas the fundamental concern of my younger brother was on who is best suited to restore national stability and the security of lives and property of Nigerians, it is as clear as the early morning sunrise that the Buhari–led administration has failed in the discharge of the primary duty of government. The primary duty of government as enshrined in Section 14 (2) (b) of the constitution is as follows: “The security and welfare of the people shall be the primary purpose of government.” It is a fact that hundreds-of-thousands of Nigerians have left the shores of Nigerian since the emergence of the current government just as those who had earlier left due to security threats have found concrete, genuine, verifiable reasons to remain where they are or risks their lives by returning at this material time. In Benue State alone, more than 1,500 persons have been killed in the last three years due to the bloody insurgency of armed Fulani herdsmen who enjoy the protection of the current administration. Plateau state has been in turmoil due largely to the violent insurgency of armed Fulani herdsmen. Southern Kaduna and Nasarawa neighbouring Abuja has had their shares of these murderous and targeted killings of Christians.  Both in words and action, key functionaries of the current government have clearly backed the activities of the armed Fulani gangsters.  The minister of Defence was quoted as blaming the anti-open grazing laws in Benue State for the bloody attacks by Fulani herdsmen. Dan-Ali the Fulani born minister of Defence had told state house reporters that the blockage of cattle routes across the country is the remote cause of the killings by herdsmen. “Whatever crisis that happens at anytime, there are remote and immediate causes. Look at this issue (killings in Benue and Taraba) what is the remote cause of the farmers’ crisis? Since the nation’s independence, we know there used to be a route whereby the cattle rearers take because they are all over the nation. If you go to Bayelsa or Ogun, you will see them. If those routes are blocked, what do you expect will happen? These people are Nigerians. It is just like one going to block the shoreline; does that make sense to you? But the immediate cause is the grazing law.” Mansur Dan-Ali, in the aforementioned thoughtless statement has demonstrated the callous insensitivity of the Buhari’s administration to the violence unleashed on Nigerians by armed Fulani herdsmen.  This also shows why the major organisation backing the Fulani herdsmen known as Miyetti Allah Cattle Owners Association, has yet to be declared a terrorist group even when they back the killings.
To be continued on tomorrow.

Oby Ezekwesili: Nobility In Service,https://guardian.ng/life/oby-ezekwesili-nobility-in-service/," Obiageli Ezekwesili was born in 1963. Ezekwesili holds a master’s degree in International Law and Diplomacy from the University of Lagos, and a Master of Public Administration degree from the Kennedy School of Government, Harvard University.  Before she obeyed the national clarion call, she worked as a chartered accountant in Deloitte and Touche and at the Center for International Development, Harvard. Her stint with the government began with her appointment as the first head of the Budget Monitoring and Price Intelligence Unit (popularly known as Due Process Unit). During her time, she was credited with changing and cleansing the method of public procurement or contracting at the Federal level in Nigeria.
In June 2005, she was appointed the Minister of Solid Minerals (Mines and Steel) and again, she kicked off a reform programme that put Nigeria on the global platform as a mining investment destination.  A year later, she became the Federal Minister of Education and in March 2007, she was appointed her Vice president of World Bank Africa region.
The co-founder of Transparency International (TI) has been named in BBC’s 100 Women, Time 100 Most Influential People, New York Times 25 Women of Impact for 2015, Albert Einstein’s Foundation’s Genius:100 Visions of the Future. In 2014, she became a co-convener of the #BringBackOurGirls campaign, the campaign addressed the kidnap of the 300 Chibok girls which received global recognition.
Owing to her achievements and her “fight against corruption”, she was nominated a recipient of the 2018 Nobel Peace Prize. The Peace Research Institute Oslo (PRIO) director Henrik Urdal described as her “an international champion in the fight against corruption… Chairperson of the Nigeria Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (NEITI), leading the first-ever national implementation of the global EITI standards.”"
Ezekwesili picks Gani Galadima as running mate,https://guardian.ng/news/ezekwesili-picks-gani-galadima-as-running-mate/,"The presidential candidate of the Allied Congress Party of Nigeria (ACPN), Oby Ezekwesili, has picked Abdulganiy Galadima as her running mate for the 2019 presidential election. This was disclosed on Wednesday in Ilorin when the presidential hopeful unveiled her full manifesto themed #ProjectRescueNigeria Galadinma, while reacting to the announcement thanked Ezekweili for her confidence for giving him a very tasking mission to be embarked upon. “As your vice presidential candidate, I want to tell you, your excellency, that I will work with you,” Galadinma said. “I will work with you to go deep down to the grassroots, to move to the length and breadth of the country trying to see to the Nigerian people,” he added."
Oby Ezekwesili: For The Love Of Nigeria,https://guardian.ng/life/oby-ezekwesili-for-the-love-of-nigeria/," Oby Ezekwesili is in the race to dislodge faltering Nigeria’s President Muhammadu Buhari. But a year ago, upending the political status quo in Africa’s most populous nation was, perhaps, only a residual thought; not something she would have loved. Twice a minister, first for education and later solid minerals under President Olusegun Obasanjo, Ezekwesili is not alien to the workings of the government. Her effort to make government procurement processes accountable and transparent as the pioneer head of the Budget Monitoring and Price Intelligence Unit earned her the nickname Madam Due Process. Her penchant for wanting things done the right way was recently acknowledged by a former president of Malawi Dr Joyce Banda. Banda describes how Ezekwesili’s counsel helped her in fighting corruption in her country. “While fighting corruption during my Presidency in 2013, @obyezeks advised me to protect myself with a forensic audit, which UK gov supported. I am forever grateful for this transparent, accountable daughter of Africa, a servant leader pushing for a better Nigeria,” Banda tweeted on November 20. Oby Ezekwesili For someone who was once a minister, an appointment, which is usually a product of political affiliation and patronage, her hatred for politics can be blamed on the rot in Nigeria’s political system. “I never had interest in politics. Anyone who knows me knows that I detest politics,” she says. “But I had to get to the place where listening to the political class say to us that we have to choose the lesser of two evils got me infuriated.” One important driving force behind her decision to cast aside her hatred for politics is the way the human lives have been cheapened since the advent of President Muhammadu Buhari’s administration. Buhari defeated the then incumbent Goodluck Jonathan in Nigeria’s general elections after campaigning to fight corruption, reposition the economy and strengthen internal security, especially in the Northeast. Ezekwesili agrees that Buhari can be given a “little bit of score” for what he has done in the strife-torn region, but insists that a government that allowed Nigeria’s economy to tank on the “back of oil shock” and wrong policy choices should not be allowed to lead the country beyond May 29, 2019. Beyond the downward spiral of the economy which has seen the unemployment rate rise to 18.80 in Q3 2017 when the last job figures were released, Ezekwesili is miffed by the spate of violence across the country and a biased anti-graft war. “This is a Nigeria under President Muhammadu Buhari where the primacy of the human life has been completely devalued…life is cheapened,” she says. “The lives of Nigerians today are not any better because President Buhari became our president. As a matter of fact, the quality of lives has taken a significant beaten.” Her misgiving about Buhari’s handling of the economy preceded her dream of being the president of Nigeria. In 2016, she lampooned the government’s “command and control” economic policies while faulting the intention of the President Buhari to protect the poor. “The president comes into this economic philosophy on the premise that he does not want the poor to suffer. I can relate to that, a leader must not allow the poor to suffer, especially a leader who knows that most of his votes came not from the elite but from the poor,” she said at The Platform, a public policy forum, in April 2016. “The problem though is that the intention and the outcome are diverged.” Obviously, her patience to continue to “relate” to such “archaic” policies ran out. Oby Ezekwesili While Ezekwesili has her mind firmly set on dethroning Buhari when the country goes to poll in the first quarter of 2019, she has to contend with a political culture that is both anti-woman and excessively moneyed. The odds are staggering. But she insists that the “fight” for “a new independence from our rapacious ruling class” is winnable. She is very much convinced that she represents millions of Nigerians who are disenchanted by years of failure of the current and past administrations. “I am not running alone,” she says with a definite conviction. “We are all running. This contest is between the political class that has failed over and over against the Nigerian people and the Nigerian people.” But in a country where the voting public is easily ingratiated by quick and fleeting political favours and an entrenched political culture that has done little to curb electoral malpractices, how she will able to best her opponents is yet to be seen. It is impossible that Ezekwesili is unaware of these odds. Yet, she brims with the hope that her dream of repositioning Nigeria for a greater good will be realised. “I am the candidate of the people,” she remarks. Oby Ezekwesili Ezekwesili is not exactly new to facing down challenges. Her activism preceded the kidnapping of the Chibok girls in 2014. She was a member and the first female leader of The Concerned Professionals Citizens Movement. The group campaigned for Nigeria’s return to democracy in the 1990s. In recent years, she has been one of the most consistent voices against misrule and the excesses of the Nigerian political class. When the Chibok Girls were kidnapped from their schools in April 2014, she became a vocal advocate for their quick rescue. #BringBackOurGirls, a movement which she co-founded adopted a number of approaches -including sits-out and marches – to pressure the then President Goodluck Jonathan to act fast rescuing of the girls. Loyalists of the sitting Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) government accused her of being a paid agent. That led into her passport being briefly seized by the agents of the state when she was travelling to London in July 2014. When power changed hands in May 2015, Nigerians hoped the new government would introduce a new system of doing things. And for Ezekwesili, her travails in the hands of the government took a drastic turn. In January, she and seven other members of the BBOG movement were arrested and detained by police while protesting for the release for the Chibok Girls. In June, her one-man march on the Nigerian State House, Abuja to protest the killings of 100 persons by suspected herdsmen in Plateau communities in June was halted by security operatives. Again, she has been at the receiving end of attacks from loyalists of the current All Progressives Congress (APC), who felt her criticism of the Buhari administration was one too many, and from agents of the PDP, who thought she was beyond being forgiven for allegedly contributing to the party’s losses at the polls in 2015. But Ezekwesili insists her advocacy for the girl child and the woman will not take a back seat in spite of her personal dream of rescuing Nigeria from the grips APC and PDP. “Chibok girls, Leah Sharibu…will permanently remain the basis of my advocacy,” she tells Guardian Life. “The advocacy that we have done concerning Chibok girls and Leah Sharibu is one that is endless. It is never going to come to an end until those girls are back.” And there is always family and friends
Left to her husband, Chinedu Ezekwesili, she would have been into active politics much earlier. He has first-hand experience about how passionate she is about solving Nigeria’s problems. And when she eventually told him that she was going to contest the presidency, there was a eureka moment. “‘Finally, my baby is ready,’ he told me when I told him,” she says. Her three sons, on the other hand, were a bit worried. But they all gave their support to her aspirations. “Our children…they know how totally committed to Nigeria I am. Even though they worry, but on the aggregate, the whole idea is, ‘Mum, go ahead and do this.’” Ezekwesili firmly believes in a family creating a culture that works for its members, without anyone being unduly disadvantaged. “Every family where people act together don’t have to debate who does what,” she says. For anyone to be a functional member of a society, she says, possession of “all the [necessary] skills is important."
Oby Ezekwesili: Running Against Corruption,https://guardian.ng/life/oby-ezekwesili-running-against-corruption/," Since her entry into active politics, Oby Ezekwesili has become one of Nigeria’s mouthpiece. Unlike the characteristic nature of Nigerian public office holders of going into oblivion after serving, Ezekwesili has remained undaunted in ensuring that Nigeria is the country she dreams of. From her times as Madam Due Process because of her radical and transparent approach to eradicating all forms of damaging practices in the government procurement process to giving counsels that is used in different countries administrations to tackle corruption, there is no doubt that the former vice president of the World Bank for Africa is ready for the role as the country’s first position. With her campaign running, she says she never had an interest in politics…”But I had to get to the place where listening to the political class say to us that we have to choose the lesser of two evils got me infuriated,” she told Guardian Life. Speaking on the Bring Back Our Girls Campaign, a committed cause she is known for, she tells Guardian Life her experience including her one-man march. “This is a Nigeria under President Muhammadu Buhari where the primacy of the human life has been completely devalued…life is cheapened,” she says. Ezekwesili is also miffed by the spate of violence across the country and a biased anti-graft war.
She is very much convinced that she represents millions of Nigerians who are disenchanted by years of failure of the current and past administrations.

"Buhari’s anti-graft war unspectacular, says Ezekwesili",https://guardian.ng/news/buharis-anti-graft-war-unspectacular-says-ezekwesili/,"Presidential aspirant, Oby Ezekwesili, on Wednesday, said that President Muhammadu Buhari has not done any spectacular work in his fight against corruption. While he was campaigning for presidency in 2015, Buhari’s manifesto was hinged on rebuilding the economy, a  strong anti-corruption war and a fight against insurgency. Buhari won at the presidential polls ahead of the then incumbent President Goodluck Jonathan, whose tenure had been riddled with allegations of grand scale corruption affecting even the fight against insurgents. However, three years into his tenure and months before the next general elections, the President, seeking re-election, has been accused of fighting a selective anti-corruption war. The Allied Congress for Progressives Change candidate said the anti-graft agencies including the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) are being used by the president to pick on members of opposition parties. “On corruption, President Buhari has not done any spectacular work,” Ezekwesili told Guardian TV. “What he has done is reduce the fight against corruption to a tunnel vision of EFCC hunting down those who have not joined the APC,” Ezekwesili said. “We are saying that fighting corruption is a comprehensive approach that looks at reducing opportunities of corruption through the kind of structural changes and systemic changes and policies that change the way that governments acts in an economy. “President Buhari has lived below the expectation of the integrity that he told us was his significant point or selling point on the basis of which Nigerians elected him.” Ezekwesili, who plans to unseat Buhari at the 2019 polls, insisted that Nigerians do not have to choose between two evils or choose the lesser evil. “Nigeria needs to be rescued from the entrenched system of politics that is a cyclical pattern of failure. We cannot be choosing any evil. We don’t need evil to fix the conditions that we have found ourselves. We need the right sets of thoughts in development. We need people with character, competence and capacity, who lead not for themselves but for the society,” she said. “I want to be that person that challenges this very artificial construct that Nigeria cannot amount to any good. We can fight and get Nigeria to that place of promise that it belongs.” The Bring Back our Girls convener noted that while there have been gains in the war against insurgency in the North east of Nigeria, the government still hasn’t taken Nigerians to the promised land. “The North east that was mostly occupied by the terrorist is not occupied to that extent. But people have not been able to all return to their neighbourhoods and communities. Lives have not been restored, we still have millions of our people in IDP camps,” Ezekwesili said. “This is the Nigeria under the President Muhammadu Buhari where the primacy of the human life has completely been devalued. Life is cheapened.” She also lamented the poor economic policies of the current government that has led the nation to be named the poverty capital by the World Poverty Clock. “The economy that was on an average growth of 5-6% was allowed to tank on the back of oil shock, but mostly because of very very wrong policy choices. the economic policy choices of the administration has put the economy in dire straits and that is something that we must fight. “The lives of Nigerians are not today any better because President Buhari became our president. The primacy of the human life has taken a significant beating.”"
Personal attacks as nature of presidential campaigns to come,https://guardian.ng/politics/personal-attacks-as-nature-of-presidential-campaigns-to-come/,"As the 2019 presidential election draws nearer, there are indications that the campaign would be characterised by personal attacks and brickbat. Already, opponents of President Mohammadu Buhari are pointing at loopholes in virtually all policies of his All Progressives Congress (APC) government. But what seems to be lacking is clear identification of the lapses and solutions to them. Prominent among the critics in recent time is the candidate of the Allied Congress Party of Nigeria (ACPN), Dr. Oby Ezekwesili. The one-time vice president of World Bank has on every available platform condemned the candidates of both Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and All Progressives Congress (APC), describing them as incompetent and corrupt. She maintained that the emergence of both Atiku Abubakar (PDP) and Mohammadu Buhari (APC) would amount to recycling of ‘political fraudsters’, which has slowed down the economic growth of the country. However, many Nigerians, think that the battle for Aso-Rock Villa is between the two vilified candidates (Buhari and Atiku), given their wide range of experience, political sagacity, structure and financial stamina to woo voters. Ezekwesili thinks otherwise, insisting that such opinion is only for the ignorant, and ought to fade off in the polity. According to her, the thought that some people are in control of some parts of the country, and so, will influence the election, is totally false. Citing example, she noted that the National Leader of APC, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu’s political strength is grossly overrated. Specifically, she noted that Tinubu, who most people think controls Lagos State, does not have control of Alimosho, the largest council area in the state, adding the he was only able to deliver 86,897 votes out of the 650,000 registered voters in Alimosho in the last presidential election. “Tinubu is believed to wield much power in the South-West. He worked for the election of President Muhammadu Buhari in 2015. Tinubu and his like in #APCPDP control only as much as we let them. Alimosho, for example, is the largest council area in Lagos State, with over 1.2 million residents, according to official census figures. In 2015, only about 650,000 of these people registered and obtained their Permanent Voters Cards (PVCs).” She added that it was because the people were faced with the unattractive choice of voting for PDP’s Goodluck Jonathan, or the anyone-but-Jonathan candidacy represented by Muhammadu Buhari, a great many voters chose to abstain from 2015 election. “At the end of the day, they only managed to conjure up 140,000 votes between them, in almighty Alimosho. This says something loud and clear that Tinubu, with all of his ‘might’ and experience in so-called grassroots politics, could, at the end of the day, deliver only 86,897 votes for his candidate Buhari and their party. Where then does the source of this his widely reported power come from? Isn’t he grossly overestimated?” ‘Butiku’
Ezekwesili, in skepticism, described the two parties as Siamese Twins that could not be separated by any doctor. She maintained that for those who have been saying that the 2019 election is anyone but Buhari would be surprised as they would be forced to sing the same song of anyone but Atiku in 2023. She maintained that both parties are not two but a single party fielding one single candidate, “and that candidate’s name is BuTiku. Yes, you heard me right, BuTiku.” She noted that any attempt to choose between the two is like asking somebody to choose between death by poison or death by gunshot. “God forbid. We cannot reject one oppressor and hand over to another. We do not love bondage. We do not enjoy suffering. God in heaven forbid. “I just laugh when I hear some people say our citizens movement will split opposition votes. But the PDP is not in opposition to the APC. The candidate of the PDP has over the past 14 years gone from PDP to AC, AC to PDP, PDP to APC and now back to PDP. These people are brothers and sisters of iniquity and impoverishment, merchants of failure and disappointment. Don’t believe that 419! They are both part of a political ruling class that has held us bound, manipulated and diminished us for decades. “Now they are auditioning to extend their streak of failure for another four years? God really forbid! The real opponent that the Nigerian people have in 2019 is this old political order that takes and takes and takes, and never replenishes anything.” ‘Obytiku’s visit’
Following Ezekwesili’s meeting with one of Nigeria’s former military rulers, Ibrahim Babangida, at his residence in Minna, Niger State, a lot of criticisms from Nigerians have assailed that visit, prominent among the critic is the presidential candidate of African Action Congress (AAC), Omoyele Sowore. Recall that Ezekwesili has been a critique of all previous governments in the country but on Monday, Ezekwesili tweeted that she met with Babangida to discuss how Nigeria must be taken out of the clutches of the old order in 2019. “I had a very candid conversation with former head of state, Ibrahim Babangida, in Minna after my speech on Human Capital Development at El Amin School. I made it clear that Nigeria must be taken out of the clutches of the Old Order. This is our mission,” she tweeted. Reacting to this, Sowore maintained that her meeting with the former military ruler should not have held. “Our dear Ezekwesili wants to stop corruption and mis-governance in Nigeria but then holds a secret session with the Godfather of corruption and bad governance, IBB. Nigerians, Ezekwesili creatively coined BUTIKU. I love it! But this single visit is OBYTIKU.” Ezekwesili warned against derogatory campaign
However, a group of Atiku’s supporters, under the aegis of Atiku for Better Nigeria, has warned Ezekwesili to desist from using derogatory remarks against Atiku and the Peoples Democratic Party, advising her to concentrate on her campaign and stop tagging other contestants and political parties as fraudsters. The group, in a statement by its National Coordinator, Benita Dike-Israel, advised Ezekwesili to learn the ropes in politics so as to avoid “falling into the abyss”. They argued that by painting Atiku and the PDP black, Ezekwesili was indicting herself and biting the fingers that fed her since she was a minister under the PDP regime. “Ezekwesili should learn not to be rude to Atiku or bite the fingers that fed her. For her to say that the PDP and Atiku lack knowledge in economy and (are) into 419 politics is self-indicting. That means her period, as Minister of Education and Solid Minerals added no value to the party that appointed her and to Nigeria as a whole; that also means that her immense credential amounts to naught and (she) has nothing new to offer. After all, a river is as good as its source; for whatever is built on void is void.” The Atiku supporters argued that by joining politics, Ezekwesili, who had been spearheading the campaign for the release of the abducted Chibok schoolgirls through the #BringBackOurGirls movement, had “diluted her fame and goodwill among ordinary Nigerians and friends of Nigeria.” According to the group, people will now begin to see Ezekwesili’s campaign for the release of the Chibok schoolgirls as “a mere ruse, smokescreen and cheap opportunity to feather her own political nest. Whereas it is her constitutional right as an eligible Nigerian to contest the election, yet she should understand politics as a game of persuasion and lobbying rather than (using) pressure group tactics of brick batting and (using) foul language. She can politicise without being rude and judgmental.”

Revisiting the Air Nigeria project,https://guardian.ng/opinion/revisiting-the-air-nigeria-project/,"Sir: When on July 18, 2018 Hadi Sirika, the Minister of State for Aviation, told a large audience, including aviation experts during a diplomatic trip to the United Kingdom of Nigeria preparedness to float Nigeria Air, many were ecstatic about the project. He said, the project was aimed at resurrecting the defunct Nigeria Airways. The project was said to bring about innovation in the Aviation sector of the country. It therefore, came as a quaking bombshell, when it was announced that the proposed project has been put on hold. One continues to wonder if the motive behind the project was well thought-out and planned, as the sudden suspension clearly portrays a wrong approach and perhaps wasteful decision.  Or how do you explain that a project supposedly well planned and driven actively was put on hold due to alleged investors’ apathy? It would be recalled that on July 18, 2018 at the Farnborough international Airshow in the UK, the Nigerian minister of state for aviation announced that the erstwhile Nigeria Airways will be making a return to the skies as Nigeria Air. The minister said the Nigerian government will inject 8.8 million dollars into Nigeria Air as viability gap funding. He said the private sector investors will bring some 300 million dollars as start-up capital.  Obviously, it was shocking when the public got to know that Nigerian Air may not fly for now. Perhaps the project would have continued if only communication was efficient or if knowledgeable Nigerians had been involved rather than the snippets dropped here and there by those in charge. Even the views of the Nigerian air operators were waved off as the experts foresaw loopholes in floating a National airline from scratch, when there were still many deficits on the act. One of the notable Nigerians who spoke against the investment was Oby Ezekwesili, the former minister of Education, who faulted the plan and financial implication of Nigerian Air. The decay of Nigeria Airways commenced in 2003, when planes became flying coffins due to substandard purchase of Aircraft. The Aviation industry has witnessed several losses of lives and property worth billions. Transportation by air became a risk to the masses, everything that could go wrong with the aviation sector did go wrong from the disengagement and payoff of the former staff still pending to the aborted or better still pending project of Nigeria Air. The project will continually be hollow and a mere drain pipe on the public fund at the expense of the Nigerian tax payer as long as the problem in the Air sector is not checked. Having a newly birthed Nigeria Air is a good and welcome development. However, it would have to go beyond Sirika’s optimism and nice words to become an achievable dream.  There must be a renewed commitment from the government and private sector players to see Nigeria Air work out, as Nigeria is a sleeping giant that has been stirred from sleep. The aviation sector is one of the sectors in the country’s economy that can shake up this giant to consciousness if well harnessed and utilised. Therefore, investors with sincere motives should be bought into plan. Also, there should be an agreed plan of such intended and magnificent project just as the place of private public partnership remains valid for this kind of idea. Furthermore, Air Nigeria should go beyond some set of political individuals. We have experts who are Nigerians and will be willing to be part of the think-thank on the initiative and this should be explored totally. Nevertheless, there should be political will to have Air Nigeria rather than vote appeal intention. A laudable project such as Air Nigeria is strategic to the economic growth of the nation and aviation sector. Government should endeavour to resuscitate it. It must not be allowed to die.

"Buhari’s government is corrupt, says Ezekwesili",https://guardian.ng/politics/buharis-government-is-corrupt-says-ezekwesili/,"A speech by Obiageli  ‘Oby’ Ezekwesili, presidential candidate of the Allied Congress Party of Nigeria at a World Press Conference on Monday, October 29, 2018 in Lagos. How can they say that we are finished?
We have just begun.
We have nowhere else to run to.
We have nowhere else to go. Ladies and gentlemen, you are welcome to this conference. When the singer TY Bello released that powerful anthem in 2011, Nigerians were on the march to a historic election. It was an election that showed us a vision of what is possible in our country – that the son of a humble fisherman from a minority tribe in the Niger Delta can rise to become president of the federal republic of Nigeria.The winner of that presidential election described his victory as “the renewal of hope” in Nigeria. And most Nigerians believed him.Until a series of own goals crashed that hope down a slippery slope, and that beautiful Nigerian dream tragically became a nightmare. In 2015, Nigerians were on the march again.
Citizens were so angry with the brand of failure posing as governance that we took a gamble and placed their hopes in today’s ruling party, the APC and President Muhammadu Buhari, a 71-year old former dictator who has now shown neither the capacity nor the aptitude for the highest office in the land. If that campaign was a movie, the title of the movie would be: “The lesser of two evils.”Everything the APC candidate did was justified and excused because he was branded as “the lesser evil.” He was given an easy ride. No serious questions were asked about his competence or track record or world view; he couldn’t even be bothered to attend a presidential debate to defend his ideas in a competitive environment. Yet he was promising CHANGE. And a majority of Nigerian voters bought what he was selling. But where is this change?
I intend to do three things here today:
First, I will lay bare what is at stake in this election by telling you why the failed PDP and its candidate, Atiku Abubakar, are not alternatives to the failed APC and its candidate, President Buhari. They are one and the same, siamese twins of failure and destruction.
Second, I will tell you why my candidacy under the Allied Congress Party of Nigeria (ACPN) represents the most prepared, most qualified and most formidable choice for 2019, and why you cannot afford to sit on the sidelines in this battle for the soul of Nigeria.Finally, I will address the most frequently repeated concerns about my candidacy and then what exactly we need to do to take this movement from here to Aso Rock. So let us look back briefly, to 2015
Do you remember? The chant all across the country was “Anyone But Jonathan.” Sadly, that is how we ended up with this reprobate government.
This time it is: “Anyone But Buhari.” And by that they mean that we should reinstate the failed PDP and its candidate, former vice president Atiku Abubakar because they think Atiku is the only person that can defeat Buhari in 2019. And in 2023, when Atiku and the PDP inevitably fail again, because a bad tree cannot bear good fruit? We will hear new chants of “Anyone But Atiku.”That is how we get looped in a cycle of insanity – repeating the same thing, and expecting a different result. That cycle of failure is unsustainable and it has to end NOW. 2019 cannot be “Anyone But Buhari”. Our country is not a recycling plant for uninspiring old men with their old ideas and old dubious characters. We deserve better than their aggressive mediocrity. And that is why I am running for president – to lead a people’s movement that will permanently terminate bad leadership, retire these incompetents and fight for every Nigerian. For those of you considering the PDP as an alternative, I really want to ask you: what is the thing that you see about them that is any different from the APC. Really? These people are the same: Siamese Twins of Failure.Fellow Nigerians, here is the truth of the matter: the APCPDP is not two parties. The #APCPDP is one single party fielding one single candidate, and that candidate’s name is #BuTiku. Yes, you heard me right – #BuTiku. Buhari and Atiku are conjoined from head to toe as #BuTiku. There is no lesser evil in #BuTiku. #BuTiku are members of the same party. Attempting to choose between these two is like asking one to choose between death by poison or death by gunshot. God forbid. We cannot reject one oppressor and hand over to another oppressor. We do not love bondage. We do not enjoy suffering. God in heaven forbid. I just laugh when I hear some people say our citizens movement will split opposition votes. But the PDP is not in opposition to the APC. The candidate of the PDP has over the past 14 years gone from PDP to AC, AC to PDP, PDP to APC and now back to PDP. These people are brothers and sisters of iniquity and impoverishment, merchants of failure and disappointment. Don’t believe that 419! They are both part of a political ruling class that has held us bound, manipulated and diminished us for decades. Now they are auditioning to extend their streak of failure for another four years? God really forbid! The real opponent that the Nigerian people have in 2019 is this old political order that takes and takes and takes, and never replenishes anything. I should know. I was headhunted from Harvard in 1999, asked to come and help as a technocrat to rebuild a country that had just been recovered from the wasted years of the military. I accepted, like many other brilliant Nigerian minds from home and abroad, and we worked together to bring due process into government, secure debt relief, open up our economy, rebuild institutions and attack poverty. The things I saw with in those days really fired me up to insist on due process, fellow Nigerians. Because for these terrible Nigerian politicians, corruption is all fun and games. These people have no desire but for more power, power, power, power. They stay up at night conspiring to steal and pillage, to loot and destroy. Oh, my brothers and sisters, I served in that government with one of the candidates who is running under #APCPDP in this election. Kai! No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Six and a half years after, in 2007, I had fought the fight that had to be fought from within, and then I left government knowing for sure that if this politicial order is not changed, the work of good governance that good people do within government will never last. I decided not to re-enter government, rebuffing every request made since, and instead made a decision to dedicate my life to activating citizens to push these blood-sucking political class out of office. I returned from the World Bank five years later to do just that, and the PDP was still at it! Same incentives, same behavior. The political class was completely unchanged – and had in fact become completely worse.For goodness sake, what has fundamentally changed about that PDP we have always known? What lessons did the party really learn after its defeat in 2015? Is this not the same PDP that looted the monies meant to equip our military, so that our soldiers had to run away at the sight of Boko Haram, because they had no weapons? The same PDP that spent precious days denying that our Chibok girls were kidnapped and so allowed the terrorists get away? Is this not the same PDP that conducted a recruitment exercise for the Immigration Service that killed scores of our young people and yet nobody was sacked or punished? Haba. How can we forget so easily! So the question is: Apart from forgetfulness, why are some Nigerians suddenly considering the PDP yet again? I have heard some people say it is because the PDP candidate has run successful businesses and therefore will be good for the economy at a time like this.That response just makes me shake my head in wonderment: Is it the same person we know, or are we speaking of another? Perhaps you never read a 2005 email from the president of Atiku’s university which was obtained by US investigators.Let me quote a small portion from that mail: “…The flow of revenue to the university will slow dramatically if Atiku’s political fortunes continue to wane… Construction delays on campus have also raised fears that the prospects for the university are linked to Atiku’s political success.”Did you just hear what that email said? That the success of that man’s private business is dependent on our commonwealth? And there was more!
A special report by a US Senate Committee on Foreign Corruption concluded that “over an eight-year period from 2000 to 2008, Atiku and his wife, Jennifer Douglas were able to bring over $40 million in suspect funds into the United States…”This was at the very time that this person was the Vice President of this very same country. And these are the people you want to put in charge of the national treasury? In charge of the money for your children’s education? Of the resources for our country’s hospitals? Of the budget for our depleted army and our impoverished police force? If we dive into all the filthy issues involving the PDP candidate – from the PTDF saga to the $2.8 million Siemens bribery scandal – we may spend the entire day here today and I simply do not have that time.So let us talk about the present administration, the evil twin.What is the primary legacy of President Muhammadu Buhari? It is the destruction of our nation’s wealth, presiding over the worst economic recession Nigeria has seen in decades. Even now that the economy has come out of recession, the growth is as sluggish as his government. 4 out of every 10 adults today are either unemployed or underemployed, and Nigeria is now the Poverty Capital of the World, the World Bank confirmining that we now have more extremely poor people than India which has a population six times our size.And in the midst of this, his Vice President was celebrating last week at the Nigeria Economic Summit that handing bailouts to state governors to pay salaries is an achievement.
What a big shame!"
"Nigerians will not choose between corruption and incompetence, Oby Ezekwesili insists",https://guardian.ng/news/nigerians-will-not-choose-between-corruption-and-incompetence-oby-ezekwesili-insists/,"Presidential candidate of the Allied Congress Party of Nigeria (ACPN), Oby Ezekwesili, has stated that Nigerians will not choose between incompetence and corruption in next year’s general elections. Describing President Muhammadu Buhari’s administration as incompetent and sluggish, she said former Vice President Abubakar Atiku was corrupt. Ezekwesili, who spoke at a media briefing in Lagos yesterday cautioned that if Nigerians repeat the mistake of 2015 by choosing a lesser evil next year, the country would suffer its consequences. She also said Vice President Yemi Osinbajo’s celebration of bailouts, as an achievement of the present administration is a colossal shame, adding that the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and All Progressives Congress (APC) are like Siamese twins of failure and destruction. “In 2015, the chant all across the country was ‘Anyone But Jonathan.’ Sadly, that is how we ended up with this reprobate government. This time it is: ‘Anyone But Buhari.’ “And by that they mean that we should reinstate the failed PDP and its candidate, because they think he is the only person that can defeat Buhari in 2019 and in 2023 when Atiku and PDP fail again, because a bad tree cannot bear good fruits.”"
"Buhari lacks aptitude to lead Nigeria, says Ezekwesili",https://guardian.ng/news/buhari-lacks-aptitude-to-lead-nigeria-says-ezekwesili/,"The presidential candidate of the Allied Congress Party of Nigeria (ACPN),Oby Ezekwesili said President Muhammadu Buhari lacks the aptitude and capacity to continue to lead Africa’s most populous country. “President Muhammadu Buhari has now shown neither the capacity nor the aptitude for the highest office in the land,” Ezekwesili said on Monday at a press conference in Lagos as her party unveiled its road-map for winning the 2019 presidential elections. “Let us talk about the present administration; what is the primary legacy of President Muhammadu Buhari? It is the destruction of our nation’s wealth — presiding over the worse economic recession Nigeria has seen in decades. “Even now that the economy has come out of recession, the growth is as sluggish as its government. Four out of every 10 adults are either unemployed or underemployed and Nigeria is now the poverty capital of the world,” she added. The APCN presidential candidate accused Buhari of being the “most nepotistic and most partisan president that Nigeria has ever seen” and said that the president who rode on the promises to fight corruption in 2015 is also “corrupt”  “This president talks about fighting grand corruption. Please, please, give me a break! Can corruption fight corruption? Does he think we cannot see?” Ezekwesili said The Presidential hopeful, who was the minister of education under the People’s Democratic party-led administration, said the opposition party is not also a better alternative to move Nigeria forward. “I just laugh when I hear some people say our citizen’s movement will split opposition votes. But the PDP is not in opposition to the APC. The candidate of the PDP has over the past 14 years gone from PDP to AC, AC to PDP, PDP to APC and now back to PDP” Ezekwesili said Ezekwesili also took a swipe at Buhari and PDP’s presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar, noting that if she eventually becomes the Nigerian president, “you will never hear any world leader call me lifeless or dishonest.” “I have no issues obtaining visas or travelling to any country in the world – whether it is the United States of America or the United Arab Emirates,” she said in a not-so-veiled reference to the PDP presidential candidate.  Recently, Financial Times reported that the United States president Donald Trump referred to Buhari as “lifeless” shortly after a meeting between the two leaders in April. The PDP presidential candidate, on his part, is rumoured to be avoiding travelling to the United States because of a pending indictment. The former minister of education, while stating her achievement in office, said she “introduced Public Private Partnership models for education service delivery and very importantly ensured that Innovation & Vocational Enterprise Institutions were accredited, certified and regulated by the National Board for Technical Education.” Ezekwesili, therefore, affirmed that the ruling party and opposition party are “brothers and sisters of iniquity and impoverishment, merchants of failure and disappointment.”"
"‘Politics is the art of the impossible, made possible’",https://guardian.ng/guardian-woman/politics-is-the-art-of-the-impossible-made-possible/,"Otto Von Bismarck once said, “Politics is the art of the possible, the attainable – the art of the next best.” Some qualify that it is also the art of the impossible. Indeed, anything is possible, as seen by the huge shake-up in African Gender Politics this month, most recently this week with Ethiopia electing its first female President, not to mention Prime Minister Aby Ahmed appointing new female ministers and enabling the country to be the first African country with 50 per cent female ministers. Then earlier there was the unprecedented candidacy announcement of Oby Ezekwesili, who’s campaigning as “the anti-establishment candidate,” and labelled by the ACPN as the “hope” candidate, in a similar fashion to Obama, back in 2008. Sadly, Nigeria is ranked far lower than nations such as South Africa, Rwanda, Uganda, Zambia and Mauritania and most recently Ethiopia among countries that encourage women to engage in politics. Rwanda with its parliament being top in the world in female representation at over 60 per cent deliberately increased women in decision-making roles and the country is progressing well economically, despite its recent dark and genocidal past. Perhaps the presence of women will in itself prevent the country from ever repeating its atrocious history. Where African politics is concerned, we are often looking at impossible situations that need to be changed, and in many parts of Nigeria, that’s the case. But how can we expect change, without getting down to the crux of these matters? Meaning, community level politics, where locals can get together and discuss and decide what their needs are. There is too much power politics in Nigeria; it’s more about power rather than policy change up top. We need the balance of a bottom-up approach, and this is where we need women to get more involved. Mothers, the people concerned about the wellbeing of their families, having access to healthcare, getting their kids to school… Women’s approach to politics is usually less about power and more about trying to solve social problems. Of course there are exceptions to this rule but women tend to try to solve community level issues, and not just women’s issues. Some may doubt the electoral power of Ms Ezekwesili, but she’s well-known for leading the #BringBackOurGirls campaign, a former education minister and a former Vice President of the World Bank’s Africa division and she’s setting a great example. When it comes to politics, women generally want to get involved in social matters worldwide and there are more female celebrities becoming ambassadors to international organisations and travelling down to communities to “mother” them, be it for a short and temporary while. Because this is what women are good at. So, wake up, ladies of Nigeria. If you don’t get involved, nothing is going to change. Politics is the art of the impossible, made possible. Let’s turn our impossible situations into possible solutions. Nigeria, we have a lot of catching up to do. We women also have to help ourselves. I believe Nigeria will accept more women bringing more to the table, but we have to engage ourselves. The men are not going to force us to do so. Former president Olusegun Obasanjo has hailed female politicians as being more “trustworthy” and recently pointed out that “no nation will become great when half of her population ends up only in the kitchen and ‘the other room’, or get disproportionately discriminated against in the higher echelons of corporate management and in governance.”

Human rights and post-2019 presidency,https://guardian.ng/opinion/human-rights-and-post-2019-presidency/,"At the weekend, I got into a very lengthy conversation with my younger brother currently based abroad and who left Nigeria when his life became endangered by open threats made by some Islamists responsible for the spate of violent attacks targeting largely Christian communities in the North of Nigeria. Our conversations centred around the deteriorated security situations not just in Nigeria but in a lot of regional neighbouring communities making up the West African nations otherwise known as Economic Community of West African States.  There is also no doubt that Nigeria is the epicenter of the expanding frontiers of Islamic terrorism. But what really triggered this mutual but frank dialogue was the emergence on Sunday noon of the erstwhile vice president Alhaji Abubakar Atiku as the official standard bearer of the largest opposition political party in the sub-Saharan African region – the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Other notable Nigerians who are flying the presidential flags of some of the newly registered political parties include the former Vice President of the World’s Bank and erstwhile Education minister, Mrs. Oby Ezekwesili; former Deputy Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria and a Professor of Economics in a U.S. based university, Dr. Kingsley Moghalu and the former governor of Cross Rivets State, Mr. Donald Duke.  Emeka, my very brilliant younger sibling is a philosopher by academic qualification and an illustrious human rights practitioner.  He is one of the intellectuals backing and participating actively and constructively in the agitations for self-determination in Nigeria of the Igbo nationality as coordinated by a completely peace loving and unarmed group of human rights activists – Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB). In addition to threats of death from government agents involved in the enforced disappearances of reputable opponents of the political status quo in Nigeria, Nigeria has become polarized alongside ethno religious fault lines.  This highly cerebral philosopher brother of mine was basically concerned about the re-emergence as president for a second tenure of one of Nigeria’s most divisive and bigoted political leaders – the retired Army General Muhammadu Buhari in the year 2019 general elections. Put differently, Emeka asked to know the post-2019 human right agenda of the President who would emerge if a transparent election is conducted. His question is how the Nigerian people can basically safeguard the sanctity of the forthcoming election given the notoriety displayed by the central electoral governing and management council known in law as the Independent National Electoral Commission. His anxiety about the lack of credibility of the current head of the independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) is also shared by millions of Nigerians who watched with considerable trepidation as the electoral umpire rigged the recently held Osun State governorship poll. Two United States senators, Chris Coons (D-Del.) and Cory Booker (D-N.J.), both members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, have raised concerns about the credibility of elections in Nigeria following allegations of political interference in the latest governorship polls. Coons and Booker said in a joint statement that though the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) had been commended by observers for its conduct of the recent polls, concerns remained about the prospects of free and fair elections in the country. The statement read, “As members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, we are troubled by reports of incidents of political interference and intimidation of voters, journalists, and civil society observers in Nigeria by some security agencies and political party supporters. Nigeria is Africa’s largest economy and a key U.S. partner on the continent. “While domestic and international election observers have credited electoral authorities for their administration of elections thus far, we are concerned about the prospects for a free, fair and credible democratic process in Nigeria in light of recent interference by government security forces on peaceful assembly and freedom of expression, as well as ongoing security threats and communal tensions in several regions of the country. “General elections in February 2019 will be an important step for Nigeria to consolidate democratic gains achieved in the last two decades since the transition from military to civilian democratic rule. We are watching the parties’ primaries with interest, and we call on party leaders, electoral authorities, security officials, and all Nigerians to respect the political process and safeguard free, fair, credible, and peaceful elections that reflect the will of the people.” Recall that governorship elections were held on September 22 in Osun State and won by the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) after initially being declared inconclusive by INEC after PDP led. After the voting on September 22, the candidate of the main opposition party, Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Senator Ademola Adeleke, had won the majority of votes. He was followed by the APC candidate, Gboyega Oyetola. But INEC declared the election inconclusive and conducted a rerun on September 27. After adding up the votes, Oyetola was declared winner by INEC. The failure to declare PDP the winner is extra constitutional because the constitution says simple majority is the deciding factor for electoral victory in that category. INEC had also awarded the APC victory in an earlier controversial governorship poll in Ekiti State on July14. In both elections, PDP and other opposition elements alleged foul play and interference by the ruling APC. The worries expressed by these two United States’ parliamentarians cuts across the feelings of millions of Nigerians who have similar sentiments that there is no assurance that the electoral panel will be transparent and ready to conduct a free, fair, peaceful and transparent general elections come 2019. As observed by these Americans, the interferences into the election come majorly from the security forces. The apprehensions that the current heads of the internal security team will compromise the election finds supports in the fact that almost all the current heads of the different armed security institutions owed their unmerited retention to the current president who is desperate for a second tenure. There is therefore the imperative demand that the fuller intents of Section 158 (1) of the constitution is respected which means that whatever measures that are needed to be enforced to guarantee independence of the electoral commission should be put in place. Whereas the fundamental concern of my younger brother was on who is best suited to restore national stability and the security of lives and property of Nigerians, it is as clear as the early morning sunrise that the Buhari–led administration has failed in the discharge of the primary duty of government. The primary duty of government as enshrined in Section 14 (2) (b) of the constitution is as follows: “The security and welfare of the people shall be the primary purpose of government.” It is a fact that hundreds-of-thousands of Nigerians have left the shores of Nigerian since the emergence of the current government just as those who had earlier left due to security threats have found concrete, genuine, verifiable reasons to remain where they are or risks their lives by returning at this material time. In Benue State alone, more than 1,500 persons have been killed in the last three years due to the bloody insurgency of armed Fulani herdsmen who enjoy the protection of the current administration. Plateau state has been in turmoil due largely to the violent insurgency of armed Fulani herdsmen. Southern Kaduna and Nasarawa neighbouring Abuja has had their shares of these murderous and targeted killings of Christians.  Both in words and action, key functionaries of the current government have clearly backed the activities of the armed Fulani gangsters.  The minister of Defence was quoted as blaming the anti-open grazing laws in Benue State for the bloody attacks by Fulani herdsmen. Dan-Ali the Fulani born minister of Defence had told state house reporters that the blockage of cattle routes across the country is the remote cause of the killings by herdsmen. “Whatever crisis that happens at anytime, there are remote and immediate causes. Look at this issue (killings in Benue and Taraba) what is the remote cause of the farmers’ crisis? Since the nation’s independence, we know there used to be a route whereby the cattle rearers take because they are all over the nation. If you go to Bayelsa or Ogun, you will see them. If those routes are blocked, what do you expect will happen? These people are Nigerians. It is just like one going to block the shoreline; does that make sense to you? But the immediate cause is the grazing law.” Mansur Dan-Ali, in the aforementioned thoughtless statement has demonstrated the callous insensitivity of the Buhari’s administration to the violence unleashed on Nigerians by armed Fulani herdsmen.  This also shows why the major organisation backing the Fulani herdsmen known as Miyetti Allah Cattle Owners Association, has yet to be declared a terrorist group even when they back the killings.
To be continued on tomorrow.

Oby Ezekwesili: Nobility In Service,https://guardian.ng/life/oby-ezekwesili-nobility-in-service/," Obiageli Ezekwesili was born in 1963. Ezekwesili holds a master’s degree in International Law and Diplomacy from the University of Lagos, and a Master of Public Administration degree from the Kennedy School of Government, Harvard University.  Before she obeyed the national clarion call, she worked as a chartered accountant in Deloitte and Touche and at the Center for International Development, Harvard. Her stint with the government began with her appointment as the first head of the Budget Monitoring and Price Intelligence Unit (popularly known as Due Process Unit). During her time, she was credited with changing and cleansing the method of public procurement or contracting at the Federal level in Nigeria.
In June 2005, she was appointed the Minister of Solid Minerals (Mines and Steel) and again, she kicked off a reform programme that put Nigeria on the global platform as a mining investment destination.  A year later, she became the Federal Minister of Education and in March 2007, she was appointed her Vice president of World Bank Africa region.
The co-founder of Transparency International (TI) has been named in BBC’s 100 Women, Time 100 Most Influential People, New York Times 25 Women of Impact for 2015, Albert Einstein’s Foundation’s Genius:100 Visions of the Future. In 2014, she became a co-convener of the #BringBackOurGirls campaign, the campaign addressed the kidnap of the 300 Chibok girls which received global recognition.
Owing to her achievements and her “fight against corruption”, she was nominated a recipient of the 2018 Nobel Peace Prize. The Peace Research Institute Oslo (PRIO) director Henrik Urdal described as her “an international champion in the fight against corruption… Chairperson of the Nigeria Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (NEITI), leading the first-ever national implementation of the global EITI standards.”"
"Factors that hinder quality education in Nigeria, by Ezekwesili, others",https://guardian.ng/features/factors-that-hinder-quality-education-in-nigeria-by-ezekwesili-others/,"Contrary to the widespread belief that inadequate funding remains the biggest draw back to the attainment of quality education in the country, former Minister of Education, Dr. Oby Ezekwesili, says there were many other factors that are silently rocking the boat. Prominent among these spoilers, she said, are poor teacher quality, incomplete curriculum, ethical gap, policy inconsistency among others challenges that must be confronted headlong. Speaking at the Third Gamaliel & Susan Foundation Lecture in Lagos, which had as its theme: “Finding Solutions to the Problems of the Nigerian Education Systems: A Multi-Stakeholder Approach,” Ezekwesili, recalled, “When I was the Minister of Education, we discovered that the more the funding for education, the less the success rate by students. That shows the issue was not funding. We also discovered that Nigeria was falling back on enrolment whether primary, secondary, or tertiary. We found out that 61 million children of primary school age do not have access to education globally, while an estimated 10.5 million of the population are Nigerians. This figure was 3.6 million more in 2015 than it was in year 2000. It is because of these statistics that Nigeria was unable to achieve the Millennium Development Goal for Education.” Speaking further, she stated that, “For every 100 pupils that go into a school system, only two will finish while the 98 will drift away. We also discovered that most students in public schools were learning nothing; we further found out that there was lack of courses in critical thinking; a yawning gap between education and workplace, poor management or running of schools, inequalities in terms of gender; inadequate attention given to early child school system among others. “We also found out that teacher quality determines as much as 70 per cent of the learning outcomes that students will achieve. The reason why Finland excels globally is precisely because of the quality of teachers in their classrooms. You cannot be in the school system in Finland without a minimum of a masters’ degree. We discovered that the curriculum needed to innovate itself to the level of modern society. For instance, in the curriculum, we found out that there was no history, so we started a reform in the curriculum from primary to tertiary schools,” she added. As a way out of this precarious situation, she advocated a National Economic Governance Conference, where all stakeholders, whether local governments, state governments, businessmen, opinion leaders, community-based organizations and civil societies would engage in a conversation. We need a conversation that is around economic governance. This makes you understand the roles of the key sectors of the economy. “We operate a federal system of government, but in reality, there are many things standing in the way of the federal system. If we enter into the conversation on the basis of what type of productivity, or competitiveness level we should  be achieving as a country, then the outcome of the conversation will lead us to how the citizens will benefit from economic growth and development. The conference should not be political but economical, whereby all zones will be represented,” she submitted. In his remarks, Senior Pastor of Trinity House, Ituah Ighodalo, charged President Muhammadu Buhari, to make education its priority, adding that there should be appropriate funding for education, as well as serious motivation for teachers. While Principal Consultant/CEO, Leading Learning Ltd, Mrs. Folasade Adefisayo in her remarks said government must be held responsible for the quality of education in the country, Chairman, Board of Directors, First Bank of Nigeria Limited, Ibukun Awosika, observed a lacuna in basic technical education, adding that the right society must be built for education to thrive."

The theme of the lecture, which is taking place at the Nigerian Institute of International Affairs (NIIA), Victoria Island, Lagos is, “Finding Solutions to the Problems of the Nigerian Education System: A Multi-stakeholder Approach.” According to a statement signed by the chief operations officer of the foundation, Toyin Olanrewaju, also in attendance at the lecture would be discussants relevant to the sector, as the lecture aims to influence policy formulation and to contribute to strategic thinking on critical issues surrounding education in the country. The statement stated that, “Education is a veritable tool necessary to equip individuals with skills required to navigate the complexities of an ever-changing world. Without doubt, education is fundamental to human existence, and provides both youths and adults the power to reflect and make choices that affect and invariably uplift their standards of living. It is a key ingredient in economic and social activity and therefore vital for effecting national development. Sadly, third world countries continue to perform below global educational ratings with Nigeria being no exception. It added, “Some of the major challenges facing the educational sector in Nigeria are access, equity, value, relevance, quality, management and funding. A vibrant economy cannot be built on lack of access to education and low attendance at schools. According to UNESCO, it was estimated that over eight million Nigerian children were out of school in 2014 – the highest in the world. Transition and completion rates are poor, with 32 per cent transiting from primary to secondary school and only 10 per cent of eligible youths in tertiary education. The average completion rate for the primary school Nigerian girl is 65 per cent and 80 per cent for boys."
Police denies banning public protests,https://guardian.ng/news/police-denies-banning-public-protests/,"The Nigerian Police on Sunday denied outlawing public protest , stating that “public protest or procession anywhere in Nigeria” is lawful insofar they are peaceful. But the Police said it will not condone any protest or procession on public highways and roads inhibiting or disallowing public freedom and right of way. “Peaceful Public protest/procession is an integral part of democratic norms,with” said police spokesman Don Awunah, “in as much as it conforms with the rule of law and public order.” “The Nigeria Police Force recognises the constitutional rights of every law abiding citizen to express his or her view through public protest/procession and other legitimate means.” The clarification became imperative after men of the Nigerian Police tried to stop members of the Bring Back Our Girls movement from marching on Presidential Villa in Abuja on Wednesday. The Oby Ezekwesili-led group had met at the Unity Fountain to proceed with its planned march but were stopped by police officers. A police officer, Abiodun Alamatu, informed Ezekwesili that he had orders to stop the protesters from embarking on a march. He said the group could not hold the protest until they presented an official permission approving the action. After the group had presented acknowledged copies of letters submitted to the police on the march, they were allowed to proceed. They were later stopped by a police deputy commissioner, M. D. Garba, who did not disclose the reasons for the blockade. The BBOG group, however, marched through the barricade to the entrance of the presidential villa where they met a pro-Buhari group. But the Force spokesman said in order to ensure that public protest or procession is not hijacked by hoodlums to unleash mayhem and disturbance of public peace, “persons or group of persons undertaking public protest or procession should endeavour to notify the police to enable the police protect and process the public procession through designated routes and destinations.”"

The police prevented a clash between the two groups. Another top member of the BBOG group, Dr. Emman Shehu condemned the action of the security operatives by disrupting the march. He said: “Our view is that they are misguided. They still fail to understand what democracy is all about. If we have a permit to march, nobody can stop us. As far as I am concerned, there is sycophancy and lack of understanding of the relationship between the citizens and the leadership in our democracy.” “They need to understand that, otherwise, they will continue to make themselves a laughing stock in the world,” Shehu added."
"Rescue Chibok girls or resign, parents tell Buhari",https://guardian.ng/news/rescue-chibok-girls-or-resign-parents-tell-buhari/,"Ezekwesili wants poor welfare of troops fighting B’Haram probed

Parents of abducted Chibok girls yesterday asked President Muhammadu Buhari to rescue them or resign. Head of the Chibok Parents, Reverend Enoch Mark, accused government of abandoning their daughters to suffer in captivity. He spoke at the truncated march of the #BringBackOurGirls advocacy group and some parents to Aso Rock Villa yesterday. Personnel of the Nigerian Police Force, Department of State Services (DSS) and some other security operatives, in similar fashion as on Monday, maintained a human barricade, preventing them access to the Presidential Villa. The group had on Monday promised to return for the march in 72 hours unless concrete actions or pronouncement came from the Presidency. Mark, father of two of the girls, said Buhari had failed the Chibok people who voted for him in 2015 with the hope that he would ensure the return of the girls. “Many Chibok parents voted you because we believed that you would ensure the return of our daughters. You promised us that you are a military man and that you cannot lie. You said the war will not be over until the girls are back,” Mark said. Also, president of Chibok-Kibaku Area Development Association (KADA), Tsambido Hosea Abana, called on the Federal Government to “quickly negotiate” the release of the girls since it has announced on different platforms that the war on terror has been won, and so can negotiate from a position of strength. KADA described as diversionary the exposure of Amina Ali Nkeki to the media. It alleged contrary to association’s advice to the Office of the National Security Adviser (ONSA), she made unguarded statements. Oby Ezekwesili, a former education minister and chieftain of the group expressed sadness over reports of poor treatment of troops at the frontlines, especially emoluments. This, Ezekwesili said, “is unacceptable and we call for an investigation.”
“At this time of immense sacrifice from our troops on the frontline, it is important to prioritize their welfare and needs, ensuring that they have no cause to complain or worry about basic needs as they serve their nation to rout the insurgents,” she said. The group later visited the British High Commissioner, Paul Arkwright, urging London to support the Nigerian Army, especially with intelligence needed to locate the girls. Mr. Arkwright said: “The UK stands in solidarity with Chibok. We are determined to do whatever we can to help find the girls. We understand how important that is, not just in Nigeria but also globally. We will do everything we can, including with the Nigerian government and the president to help find the girls.”"

Led by Aisha Yesufu and Oby Ezekwesili, the group said: “President Muhammadu Buhari cannot anymore be unclear on what decision to make on the option to pursue for their rescue. We reject the recurrent excuses by the President that the Federal Government does not know which faction of the splintered terrorist group it should engage in negotiations. Our Federal Government must never again sound incapable of intelligence and negotiation expertise.” It called for a swift and firm decision on immediate rescue of the schoolgirls, suggesting military operation, negotiation with Boko Haram or a combination of both. Security operatives from the Department of State Services (DSS), the Nigerian Police Force (NPF) and the Nigeria Security and Civil Defense Corps (NSCDC) fended off the marchers. The group, however, went ahead to read its statement. There was an exchange of words between Ezekwesili and Chief Superintendent of Police, Chuks Obasi, who insisted: “I have my mandate, and my mandate is to ensure that a protest march does not assume a violent dimension.” Meanwhile, the United Nations Assistant Secretary General, Toby Lanzer, has warned that Nigerian authorities and regional players may be chasing shadows in the fight against insurgency unless poverty is tackled. Lanzer, during a media briefing following his visit to Bama, Borno State, regretted: “We are not addressing the root of this crisis. It is not something you put on the shoulders of humanitarians but towards the eradication of poverty.” This comes as the Department of State Services (DSS) said it arrested 23 suspects for various criminal offences, including a Boko Haram spiritual leader. Spokesman of the Service, Tony Opuiyo, in a statement, yesterday, said the leader of the sect, Mudaisiru Jibrin (aka Namakele/Alarama), was arrested last month in Kano."

Mr. Arkwright said: “The UK stands in solidarity with Chibok. We are determined to do whatever we can to help find the girls.

"Factors that hinder quality education in Nigeria, by Ezekwesili, others",https://guardian.ng/features/factors-that-hinder-quality-education-in-nigeria-by-ezekwesili-others/,"Contrary to the widespread belief that inadequate funding remains the biggest draw back to the attainment of quality education in the country, former Minister of Education, Dr. Oby Ezekwesili, says there were many other factors that are silently rocking the boat. Prominent among these spoilers, she said, are poor teacher quality, incomplete curriculum, ethical gap, policy inconsistency among others challenges that must be confronted headlong. Speaking at the Third Gamaliel & Susan Foundation Lecture in Lagos, which had as its theme: “Finding Solutions to the Problems of the Nigerian Education Systems: A Multi-Stakeholder Approach,” Ezekwesili, recalled, “When I was the Minister of Education, we discovered that the more the funding for education, the less the success rate by students. That shows the issue was not funding. We also discovered that Nigeria was falling back on enrolment whether primary, secondary, or tertiary. We found out that 61 million children of primary school age do not have access to education globally, while an estimated 10.5 million of the population are Nigerians. This figure was 3.6 million more in 2015 than it was in year 2000. It is because of these statistics that Nigeria was unable to achieve the Millennium Development Goal for Education.” Speaking further, she stated that, “For every 100 pupils that go into a school system, only two will finish while the 98 will drift away. We also discovered that most students in public schools were learning nothing; we further found out that there was lack of courses in critical thinking; a yawning gap between education and workplace, poor management or running of schools, inequalities in terms of gender; inadequate attention given to early child school system among others. “We also found out that teacher quality determines as much as 70 per cent of the learning outcomes that students will achieve. The reason why Finland excels globally is precisely because of the quality of teachers in their classrooms. You cannot be in the school system in Finland without a minimum of a masters’ degree. We discovered that the curriculum needed to innovate itself to the level of modern society. For instance, in the curriculum, we found out that there was no history, so we started a reform in the curriculum from primary to tertiary schools,” she added. As a way out of this precarious situation, she advocated a National Economic Governance Conference, where all stakeholders, whether local governments, state governments, businessmen, opinion leaders, community-based organizations and civil societies would engage in a conversation. We need a conversation that is around economic governance. This makes you understand the roles of the key sectors of the economy. “We operate a federal system of government, but in reality, there are many things standing in the way of the federal system. If we enter into the conversation on the basis of what type of productivity, or competitiveness level we should  be achieving as a country, then the outcome of the conversation will lead us to how the citizens will benefit from economic growth and development. The conference should not be political but economical, whereby all zones will be represented,” she submitted. In his remarks, Senior Pastor of Trinity House, Ituah Ighodalo, charged President Muhammadu Buhari, to make education its priority, adding that there should be appropriate funding for education, as well as serious motivation for teachers. While Principal Consultant/CEO, Leading Learning Ltd, Mrs. Folasade Adefisayo in her remarks said government must be held responsible for the quality of education in the country, Chairman, Board of Directors, First Bank of Nigeria Limited, Ibukun Awosika, observed a lacuna in basic technical education, adding that the right society must be built for education to thrive."

The theme of the lecture, which is taking place at the Nigerian Institute of International Affairs (NIIA), Victoria Island, Lagos is, “Finding Solutions to the Problems of the Nigerian Education System: A Multi-stakeholder Approach.” According to a statement signed by the chief operations officer of the foundation, Toyin Olanrewaju, also in attendance at the lecture would be discussants relevant to the sector, as the lecture aims to influence policy formulation and to contribute to strategic thinking on critical issues surrounding education in the country. The statement stated that, “Education is a veritable tool necessary to equip individuals with skills required to navigate the complexities of an ever-changing world. Without doubt, education is fundamental to human existence, and provides both youths and adults the power to reflect and make choices that affect and invariably uplift their standards of living. It is a key ingredient in economic and social activity and therefore vital for effecting national development. Sadly, third world countries continue to perform below global educational ratings with Nigeria being no exception. It added, “Some of the major challenges facing the educational sector in Nigeria are access, equity, value, relevance, quality, management and funding. A vibrant economy cannot be built on lack of access to education and low attendance at schools. According to UNESCO, it was estimated that over eight million Nigerian children were out of school in 2014 – the highest in the world. Transition and completion rates are poor, with 32 per cent transiting from primary to secondary school and only 10 per cent of eligible youths in tertiary education. The average completion rate for the primary school Nigerian girl is 65 per cent and 80 per cent for boys."

If we enter into the conversation on the basis of what type of productivity, or competitiveness level we should  be achieving as a country, then the outcome of the conversation will lead us to how the citizens will benefit from economic growth and development. The conference should not be political but economical, whereby all zones will be represented,” she submitted. In his remarks, Senior Pastor of Trinity House, Ituah Ighodalo, charged President Muhammadu Buhari, to make education its priority, adding that there should be appropriate funding for education, as well as serious motivation for teachers. While Principal Consultant/CEO, Leading Learning Ltd, Mrs. Folasade Adefisayo in her remarks said government must be held responsible for the quality of education in the country, Chairman, Board of Directors, First Bank of Nigeria Limited, Ibukun Awosika, observed a lacuna in basic technical education, adding that the right society must be built for education to thrive."
Ezekwesili to deliver keynote address at Onosode Foundation lecture,https://guardian.ng/features/ezekwesili-to-deliver-keynote-address-at-onosode-foundation-lecture/,"Former Minister of Education and Co-Founder, Transparency International, Dr. Oby Ezekwesili, CFR, will today deliver the keynote address at the 2016 lecture of the Gamaliel & Susan Onosode Foundation. The theme of the lecture, which is taking place at the Nigerian Institute of International Affairs (NIIA), Victoria Island, Lagos is, “Finding Solutions to the Problems of the Nigerian Education System: A Multi-stakeholder Approach.” According to a statement signed by the chief operations officer of the foundation, Toyin Olanrewaju, also in attendance at the lecture would be discussants relevant to the sector, as the lecture aims to influence policy formulation and to contribute to strategic thinking on critical issues surrounding education in the country. The statement stated that, “Education is a veritable tool necessary to equip individuals with skills required to navigate the complexities of an ever-changing world. Without doubt, education is fundamental to human existence, and provides both youths and adults the power to reflect and make choices that affect and invariably uplift their standards of living. It is a key ingredient in economic and social activity and therefore vital for effecting national development. Sadly, third world countries continue to perform below global educational ratings with Nigeria being no exception. It added, “Some of the major challenges facing the educational sector in Nigeria are access, equity, value, relevance, quality, management and funding. A vibrant economy cannot be built on lack of access to education and low attendance at schools. According to UNESCO, it was estimated that over eight million Nigerian children were out of school in 2014 – the highest in the world. Transition and completion rates are poor, with 32 per cent transiting from primary to secondary school and only 10 per cent of eligible youths in tertiary education. The average completion rate for the primary school Nigerian girl is 65 per cent and 80 per cent for boys."
Police denies banning public protests,https://guardian.ng/news/police-denies-banning-public-protests/,"The Nigerian Police on Sunday denied outlawing public protest , stating that “public protest or procession anywhere in Nigeria” is lawful insofar they are peaceful. But the Police said it will not condone any protest or procession on public highways and roads inhibiting or disallowing public freedom and right of way. “Peaceful Public protest/procession is an integral part of democratic norms,with” said police spokesman Don Awunah, “in as much as it conforms with the rule of law and public order.” “The Nigeria Police Force recognises the constitutional rights of every law abiding citizen to express his or her view through public protest/procession and other legitimate means.” The clarification became imperative after men of the Nigerian Police tried to stop members of the Bring Back Our Girls movement from marching on Presidential Villa in Abuja on Wednesday. The Oby Ezekwesili-led group had met at the Unity Fountain to proceed with its planned march but were stopped by police officers. A police officer, Abiodun Alamatu, informed Ezekwesili that he had orders to stop the protesters from embarking on a march. He said the group could not hold the protest until they presented an official permission approving the action. After the group had presented acknowledged copies of letters submitted to the police on the march, they were allowed to proceed. They were later stopped by a police deputy commissioner, M. D. Garba, who did not disclose the reasons for the blockade. The BBOG group, however, marched through the barricade to the entrance of the presidential villa where they met a pro-Buhari group. But the Force spokesman said in order to ensure that public protest or procession is not hijacked by hoodlums to unleash mayhem and disturbance of public peace, “persons or group of persons undertaking public protest or procession should endeavour to notify the police to enable the police protect and process the public procession through designated routes and destinations.”"
"Police, pro-Buhari group stop BBOG march to presidential villa",https://guardian.ng/news/police-pro-buhari-group-stop-bbog-march-to-presidential-villa/,"Officers of the Nigeria Police and a pro-Buhari group yesterday prevented the Bring Back Our Girls (BBOG) protesters from marching to the Presidential Villa in Abuja. The Oby Ezekwesili-led group had met at the Unity Fountain to proceed with its planned march but were stopped by police officers. A police officer, Abiodun Alamatu, informed Ezekwesili that he had orders to stop the protesters from embarking on a march. He said the group could not hold the protest until they presented an official permission approving the action. After the group had presented acknowledged copies of letters submitted to the police on the march, they were allowed to proceed. They were later stopped by a police deputy commissioner, M. D. Garba, who did not disclose the reasons for the blockade. The BBOG group, however, marched through the barricade to the entrance of the presidential villa where they met a pro-Buhari group. While speaking on behalf of the pro-Buhari group, Idris King condemned the actions of the BBOG crusaders. He said: “They were only using the case of the Chibok girls as a scam.” King said President Buhari was doing everything possible to rescue the missing schoolgirls alive. The police prevented a clash between the two groups. Another top member of the BBOG group, Dr. Emman Shehu condemned the action of the security operatives by disrupting the march. He said: “Our view is that they are misguided. They still fail to understand what democracy is all about. If we have a permit to march, nobody can stop us. As far as I am concerned, there is sycophancy and lack of understanding of the relationship between the citizens and the leadership in our democracy.” “They need to understand that, otherwise, they will continue to make themselves a laughing stock in the world,” Shehu added."
"Rescue Chibok girls or resign, parents tell Buhari",https://guardian.ng/news/rescue-chibok-girls-or-resign-parents-tell-buhari/,"Ezekwesili wants poor welfare of troops fighting B’Haram probed

Parents of abducted Chibok girls yesterday asked President Muhammadu Buhari to rescue them or resign. Head of the Chibok Parents, Reverend Enoch Mark, accused government of abandoning their daughters to suffer in captivity. He spoke at the truncated march of the #BringBackOurGirls advocacy group and some parents to Aso Rock Villa yesterday. Personnel of the Nigerian Police Force, Department of State Services (DSS) and some other security operatives, in similar fashion as on Monday, maintained a human barricade, preventing them access to the Presidential Villa. The group had on Monday promised to return for the march in 72 hours unless concrete actions or pronouncement came from the Presidency. Mark, father of two of the girls, said Buhari had failed the Chibok people who voted for him in 2015 with the hope that he would ensure the return of the girls. “Many Chibok parents voted you because we believed that you would ensure the return of our daughters. You promised us that you are a military man and that you cannot lie. You said the war will not be over until the girls are back,” Mark said. Also, president of Chibok-Kibaku Area Development Association (KADA), Tsambido Hosea Abana, called on the Federal Government to “quickly negotiate” the release of the girls since it has announced on different platforms that the war on terror has been won, and so can negotiate from a position of strength. KADA described as diversionary the exposure of Amina Ali Nkeki to the media. It alleged contrary to association’s advice to the Office of the National Security Adviser (ONSA), she made unguarded statements. Oby Ezekwesili, a former education minister and chieftain of the group expressed sadness over reports of poor treatment of troops at the frontlines, especially emoluments. This, Ezekwesili said, “is unacceptable and we call for an investigation.”
“At this time of immense sacrifice from our troops on the frontline, it is important to prioritize their welfare and needs, ensuring that they have no cause to complain or worry about basic needs as they serve their nation to rout the insurgents,” she said. The group later visited the British High Commissioner, Paul Arkwright, urging London to support the Nigerian Army, especially with intelligence needed to locate the girls. Mr. Arkwright said: “The UK stands in solidarity with Chibok. We are determined to do whatever we can to help find the girls. We understand how important that is, not just in Nigeria but also globally. We will do everything we can, including with the Nigerian government and the president to help find the girls.”"
Advocacy group knocks presidency on abducted Chibok girls,https://guardian.ng/news/advocacy-group-knocks-presidency-on-abducted-chibok-girls/,"• Govt not tackling root of insurgency, warns UN chief
• DSS arrests Boko Haram leader Abuja-based #Bring Back Our Girls advocacy group staged a march to the Aso Rock Villa, yesterday, calling on the presidency to do more to secure release of the abducted Chibok girls. Led by Aisha Yesufu and Oby Ezekwesili, the group said: “President Muhammadu Buhari cannot anymore be unclear on what decision to make on the option to pursue for their rescue. We reject the recurrent excuses by the President that the Federal Government does not know which faction of the splintered terrorist group it should engage in negotiations. Our Federal Government must never again sound incapable of intelligence and negotiation expertise.” It called for a swift and firm decision on immediate rescue of the schoolgirls, suggesting military operation, negotiation with Boko Haram or a combination of both. Security operatives from the Department of State Services (DSS), the Nigerian Police Force (NPF) and the Nigeria Security and Civil Defense Corps (NSCDC) fended off the marchers. The group, however, went ahead to read its statement. There was an exchange of words between Ezekwesili and Chief Superintendent of Police, Chuks Obasi, who insisted: “I have my mandate, and my mandate is to ensure that a protest march does not assume a violent dimension.” Meanwhile, the United Nations Assistant Secretary General, Toby Lanzer, has warned that Nigerian authorities and regional players may be chasing shadows in the fight against insurgency unless poverty is tackled. Lanzer, during a media briefing following his visit to Bama, Borno State, regretted: “We are not addressing the root of this crisis. It is not something you put on the shoulders of humanitarians but towards the eradication of poverty.” This comes as the Department of State Services (DSS) said it arrested 23 suspects for various criminal offences, including a Boko Haram spiritual leader. Spokesman of the Service, Tony Opuiyo, in a statement, yesterday, said the leader of the sect, Mudaisiru Jibrin (aka Namakele/Alarama), was arrested last month in Kano."
