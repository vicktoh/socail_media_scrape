"Nigerian religious leaders worse than political rulers, says Aisha Yesufu",https://guardian.ng/news/nigerian-religious-leaders-worse-than-political-rulers-says-aisha-yesufu/,"Human rights activist Aisha Yesufu has said that religious leaders in Nigeria are worse than those in governance, adding that they benefit from bad governance. She also said the situation helps religious leaders “sell cheap miracles and power points”. Yesufu said this in response to a post by William Folorunsho Kumuyi, the founder and General Superintendent of the Deeper Christian Life Ministry, in which the latter warned Christians not to hate those in government. In response to those in government failing to deliver on pre-election promises, Kumuyi spoke out against the destruction of private and public property. “We teach that if you’re a genuine believer in [Jesus] Christ, you wouldn’t hate your neighbour. Nor would you disdain those in power because they appear not to be delivering on electoral pledges such that you would go on the rampage, destroying government property or pillaging the public till,” wrote the clergyman.” He added: “We teach a linear life of Christian walk: you can’t be a saint on Sunday and a monster on Monday.” However, Yesufu, who was one of the leaders of the #EndSARS protests in October 2020, which resulted in the destruction of private and public property, chastised religious leaders for their role in the country’s situation. “Religious rulers in Nigeria are worse than political rulers,” she posted on Twitter on Tuesday. “They keep the people enslaved. They also need bad governance to sell cheap miracles and power points! “Until you free people from the clutches of their mallams, pastors, dibias, babalawos & boka, nothing will change.”"
"Gender parity, equity resonate as women reject discrimination ",https://guardian.ng/news/gender-parity-equity-resonate-as-women-reject-discrimination/,"• We’re not asking for lower standards for women, says CDD boss
• ‘It is a call for partnership, collaboration, and amity
• Yesufu blames Nigeria’s woes on women relegation
• Ihekweazu faults maternal policy
• COVID-19 worsened violence against women, girls, says UN Women have called for an equitable society devoid of discrimination to enable them thrive. They demand inclusion in the nation’s decision-making process and level-playing ground with their male counterparts for a better society. They spoke in separate interviews with The Guardian in commemoration of International Women’s Day (IWD), which is celebrated every March 8. The theme for this year’s celebration is #ChooseToChallenge. They spoke just as the United Nations (UN) lamented that this year’s celebration came at a very trying time. IWD is a global day celebrating the social, economic, cultural and political achievements of women. The day also marks a call to action for accelerating gender parity. Significant activity is witnessed worldwide as groups come together to celebrate women’s achievements or rally for women’s equality. International Women’s Day was celebrated for the first time by the United Nations in 1975. Then in December 1977, the General Assembly adopted a resolution proclaiming a United Nations Day for Women’s Rights and International Peace to be observed on any day of the year by member states, in accordance with their historical and national traditions. IN their comments to celebrate this year’s edition in the country, the Executive Director, Centre for Democracy and Development (CDD), Idayat Hassan, human rights activist, Aisha Yesufu, President, Women Arise, Dr. Joe Okei Odumakin and Managing Director, Nigeria Health Watch, a health communication and advocacy organisation, Mrs. Vivianne Ihekweazu, lamented the continuous marginalisation of women in the scheme of things and demanded an immediate end to it. Women representation in Nigerian parliament has been low. The situation reduces the support that can be garnered from the bicameral legislature for issues affecting women. This is in contrast with the situation in Rwanda, where women representation in the parliament accounts for 61.3 per cent in the Lower House and 38.5 per cent in the Upper House. This makes Rwanda the country with the highest representation of women in parliament out of 192 countries presented on the global database. Hassan noted that due to years of marginalisation against women, issues of direct importance to them are not given the needed attention. To buttress her claim, she pointed out that frontline issues like maternal and child mortality, poverty, armed and violent conflicts disproportionately affect women. The CDD boss said the problems of  marginalisation, poverty and inequality confronting women are further worsened by COVID-19 pandemic, which affected businesses, particularly in the informal and small-scale sector dominated by women. Hassan described current attempts at redressing injustices against women as fundamentally flawed, saying to have a just, fair, and inclusive society, women must be part of decision-making, to define and push their agenda. She said: “The argument is not for the standards to be lowered for women; our position is that women should no longer be treated as passive agents of their progress. They have to be active drivers so that the outcomes of their exertions can be organic and much more participatory. “If you look at societies making progress around the world, they came to the realisation that they cannot afford to discountenance the talents, abilities and human resource embedded in their women. Those societies worked systematically to address the injustices, prejudices and narrow mindset, which held women back. The call for inclusion and an end to marginalisation should not be misinterpreted as a divisive call for women to “take over.” It is a call for partnership, collaboration, and amity, without which a society cannot take the strides it requires in its march to progress,” Hassan added. To actualise this, the rights activist said there must be a systemic change through a democratic process. The director tasked women to rise above the challenges to bring about the desired change. ODUMAKIN identified some of the challenges confronting women as poverty, lack of access to education, economic deprivation, gender-based violence and inequality, especially in work places. To address these challenges, Odumakin canvasses a legislation that would protect women from discrimination and abuses, while violators of women’s rights are made to face the law. She warned that until the nation criminalises violence and other forms of abuses against women, there may be no difference anytime soon. Odumakin urged women to remain committed to issues that seek to uplift them, continuously demand for their pride of place and resist suppression by societal factors that perpetually seek to make them lesser beings. Yesufu, on her part, said gender inequality has hindered women from thriving over the years. IN leadership roles, Yesufu wondered why a woman who is educated and has capacity for everything is prevented from joining politics; and when eventually allowed is relegated to the background in the scheme of things. She said: “I look forward to a time when it would sound so ridiculous that a day is set aside for women, because there won’t be need for such if women are giving a level-playing field, equity and get to be treated as human beings first, not just as a woman “Imagine, not because of your gender, capacity or what you are able to bring to the table, you are not given a level-playing field. A woman is paid less because of gender and not because the quality of her work is not good. The world is not in a better place today because we are treating human beings based on gender and 50 per cent of that gender is being sidelined, treated as second-class citizens. I think what we need to do is to allow women to be,” Yesufu added. As Nigerians joined the rest of the world to celebrate, Yesufu enjoined women to be guided by the theme of this year’s IWD, stressing: “We should challenge the little voices planted in our heads when we were little that said we couldn’t achieve as much as we could, we should challenge those little voices that said we cannot be independent, be leaders or excel, we need to quash those voices.” She tasked women to stop waiting for men, create their own spaces and excel there. MANAGING Director, Nigeria Health Watch, a health communication and advocacy organisation, Vivianne Ihekweazu, urged government to look at ways of making the workplace more equitable, in terms of access to opportunities for women and ensuring that they get leadership positions. Ihekweazu also wondered why women who are doing the same job as their male counterparts should not be paid as men, adding that there should be no pay discrimination based on gender. While advocating for a policy that would ensure equity in the workplace, Ihekweazu said the current maternal policy does not favour women. She added: “We do not have enough women in leadership positions and as a result, when it comes to making decisions that affect women, they are often not at the table literally to be able to influence issues affecting their lives. How many women are in management positions in a lot of government agencies and when it comes to promotion or otherwise, are women given the same opportunity as men? What I’m saying in essence is that women should be given the same opportunity as men to lead organisations or put forward for leadership positions. Out of the about 50 ministers, only a few of them are women.
It can’t be right in a country where half the population is women. So, women are under represented in leadership positions in the country. Are women put forward for leadership positions or are they giving the same opportunity to rise to leadership positions? UN Women Executive Director, Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka, in a statement to commemorate this year’s IWD, said the celebration came at a difficult time for the world and for gender equality, but at a perfect moment to fight for transformative action, salute women and young people for their drive for gender equality and human rights. Mlambo-Ngcuka, said the focus is on women’s leadership and on ramping up representation in all the areas where decisions are made – currently mainly by men – about the issues that affect women’s lives. The UN boss lamented that the lack of representation of women’s interests has gone on too long. The statement read in part: “As we address the extraordinary hardship that COVID-19 has brought to millions of women and girls and their communities, we also look ahead to the solid opportunities of the generation equality forum and action coalitions to bring change. “During the pandemic, we have seen increased violence against women and girls and lost learning for girls as school drop-out rates, care responsibilities and child marriages rise. We are seeing tens of millions more women plunge into extreme poverty, as they lose their jobs at a higher rate than men, and pay the price for a lack of digital access and skills.”

On Buhari’s ‘body language’ and students’ abduction,https://guardian.ng/opinion/on-buharis-body-language-and-students-abduction/,"Sir: Kinesics is a field in the communication firmament that specialises in “body language.” Body language involves the use of eye contact, hand gesture, body movement, and what have you, in establishing, reinforcing and reiterating meanings between two or more parties, which wouldn’t have been ordinarily expressed verbally or orally.  Arising from the abduction of over 300 schoolgirls in Government Girls Secondary School, Jangebe, Zamfara State, on Friday, February 26, #BringBackOurGirls co-convener Aisha Yesufu has come out to decry and declare the general abduction of schoolboys and schoolgirls as a result of the President’s “body language.”  I suspect what Yesufu takes to be Buhari’s body language technically differs from the perception of body language as deployed in enhancing common ground among individuals. She speculates that body language is “saying one thing and doing another thing.” And, what’s more, this is what the Buhari regime has been demonstrating from the kidnap of the Chibok, Dapchi and Jangebe girls, on the one hand, to the Kankara and Kagara boys, on the other hand.	  The intuition that our words do not match our actions becomes clear. Buhari’s body language is, according to Yesufu, “ineffective” and “incompetent.” Yesufu could have been presupposing that ideal leadership is not parameterised after the ability to talk – but the ability to act. In other words, talk is cheap. And since actions are costly, many there are who daren’t carry out life-changing actions. Weapons of mass actions are what we actually need in rescuing the North in students’ abduction.	  I think Buhari has been eminently passive, but eloquently active, not inspired by previous attacks to actionably intervene on the tragic and historic scene we’re distastefully watching and hearing every now and then. So it’s about time we became real political actors and participators. Our mouths shouldn’t any longer be far away from our hearts. That is, our confession should match our action. In developed nations where the grundnorm of democracy is highly hinged on the led-people, the people are always at the centre of decision making. The people are always at the forefront of every developmental agendum and sustainable development goal.  If we really lead human beings, we need to cherish and value their trust by not betraying and leaving their hopes in shame and shambles; we need to respect public opinions above public office or political ambitions, and we need to, above all, remain faithful and committed to the promise we made and the oath we swore in seeking their votes and assuming office.	  Our attitudes and dispositions should not be patterned after the similitude of Trumpism, which, to me, is saying one thing and doing another thing. That’s not how to communicate effective meaning to the audience: The “body language” is not meant to act against the “mouth language,” but meant to act on it to carry out the “speaker’s meaning.”

"Owonikoko, Yesufu, others bag Martin Luther King award",https://guardian.ng/news/owonikoko-yesufu-others-bag-martin-luther-king-award/,"Olusola Owonikoko, Aisha Yesufu and eight others have been awarded for devoting time and energy to improve the lives of others by becoming beacons of light within their communities.

"Aisha Yesufu doesn’t fit in, and that’s why she fits in",https://guardian.ng/saturday-magazine/life-a-style/aisha-yesufu-doesnt-fit-in-and-thats-why-she-fits-in/,"Two things that aren’t supposed to go together: bread and noodles. But if you do summon courage and with that audacity venture into the unknown, you are likely to find taste buds surprised. Your surprise will then breed stories. Stories of delicious shock and wonder that you will share on twitter, and that might go viral. But you know what other combination aren’t supposed to make sense? A woman in hijab and a nationwide anti-police-brutality march. When you put them together though, you will certainly be surprised. And surprise, as I just suggested, is the mother of great stories. Which is why the world cannot stop talking about Aisha Yesufu. Her ‘type’ doesn’t belong in the canon of civil disobedience—she’s a Muslim woman, she’s based in the North of Nigeria, she’s married with grown children. Yet there she is, there she always is, at the forefront, vociferous, relentless, even justifying why dying for one of the causes she’s pushed for more than five years wouldn’t be an unheard of way to go. Earlier this week, while being interviewed on the combative TVC show, Fireworks, Ms Yesufu waved off the threats to her life because they have become common. What has she not been condemned to death for? “There have been calls for me to be killed,” she said, “that I’m not a Muslim, that I’m an infidel, that I hate Islam, that I’m a gay rights activist. And then ironically, of course, the gay people say I’m homophobic.” You wonder how she’s able to sleep at night with such rife glowering pointed at her. Something must kill a man—or woman—is how she frames it. And she’d rather her death, while she deliberately lives her life “to the fullest” every day, isn’t meaningless or stupid. “For me death is when I’m unable to speak against injustice because I’m afraid to die,” she said. “I would rather die standing and on my own terms.” But why? What does Aisha Yesufu want? From where has she materialised? What makes a 46-year-old middleclass woman, born to Edo natives and raised in Kano, a university graduate (Bayero University, Kano), and is married to a civil servant, continually conscript herself into some of the most blatant public confrontations with the government? From when she burst onto the Nigerian psyche in 2014 as a cofounder of the Bring Back Our Girls group—the movement to pressure Aso Rock to find and rescue by any means necessary the 276 schools girls who had been abducted by Boko Haram from a high school in Chibok, Borno State—to the Say No To Social Media Bill in 2015, and now the #ENDSARS protests, she is constantly on the streets, fighting, mostly with biting words. These battles cannot be ignored because, as she sees it, the Nigerian population has become an endless supply of sitting ducks that are plucked off randomly. Somebody has to do something. Now, if that somebody happens to be Aisha Yesufu, why not? “Yesterday’s victims were once survivors, today’s victims were yesterday’s survivors, tomorrows victims will be today’s survivors… Being a victim in Nigeria today is not a matter of if, it’s a matter of when.” The superficial incongruity between Ms Yesufu’s persona and her social justice mission aside, she has since learnt and mastered the friendly, relatable cadence of social media, especially Twitter — which is usually the place to kick-off mass action. Yesufu’s timeline isn’t an infinite stream of anger — she speaks of other things, too, like the syrupy love affair she has with her studious husband. Sometimes she permits herself to engage in amusing back-and-forth with her followers, or she could talk about her money-making investments such as her property, renting for worth N2 million ($12,500) in 2007 but, due to the naira’s steady tumble against the dollar, rents today for N2.5 million, a ton of money in naira but, exchanging for only $5,000, is just atrocious. Strange, constant, twitter-savvy, congenial outside her battlegrounds, Yesufu rose to icon status in 2020. Two things have happened to confirm this. The second is her naming this week to the BBC 100 Women list. The broadcaster writes on its site that, to be included, the women either made headlines or influenced important stories over the past 12 months. Aisha is in the company of Bilkis, the 82-year-old protest leader; Erica Baker, a director of engineering at GitHub; Jackie Kay, Welsh poet; and others of just as illustrious profile—doctors, actors, models, an astronaut, singers, and politicians. How about the first thing that happened to seal her legend? It was that picture. You’ve seen the picture. She’s in her hijab. Wind blowing. A crowd behind her. Her fist raised. Some say it’s Nigeria’s version of Lady Liberty. The photo was taken on October 10 at the police headquarters in Abuja—early days of the #ENDSARS demonstrations. Protesters who had gone to present their demands to the Inspector General of Police had just been told that the man was away. Aisha was in the back of the group. Everyone vowed they’d wait for the IG, no matter how long it took for him to return to his office. “That was when I came to the front,” Yesufu said, “and I stood and said to the police: ‘If you are going to shoot at them, you will have to put a bullet through me first.” That was the moment. Cameras clicked. History made. Perhaps, the future will place her as a marker to that history. In the meantime, she has said she would keep pushing for that thing that started her on this journey six years ago — the truth. “Accountability and transparency will always trump anything. And where you have opacity, that’s where you have corruption.”

Campaigners set to elect leaders as police urge halt to violence,https://guardian.ng/news/campaigners-set-to-elect-leaders-as-police-urge-halt-to-violence/,"The #EndSARS protesters are set to elect their leaders across the country, just few days after President Muhammadu Buhari’s speech, which has been widely censured for its content. A group, suspected to be in the protest, disclosed to The Guardian that provision had been made for online voting via Google form. Buhari had last week Thursday appealed to the youths to discontinue the protests, noting that their demands had been noted and would soon be attended to. However, he did not mention the killing of unarmed protesters at Lekki Tollgate, Lagos State, let alone offering apologies. Not satisfied with the President’s offer, the coalition of protest groups across Nigeria, in a statement, noted that the struggle must continue but with a new strategy. Nominees for the election include Folarin Falana (a.k.a. Falz), Aisha Yesufu, Timi Dakolo, Feyikemi Abudu, Editi Effiong and rap artiste, Jude Abaga (a.k,a, MI). Former education minister, Oby Ezekwesili; a pastor, Sam Adeyemi; as well as Ibukun Awosika and Amina Salihu, are listed among nominees as advisers.
MEANWHILE, the Delta State Police Commissioner, Hafiz Inuwa, has appealed to the protesters to discontinue, saying his command would implement whatever decision reached by the Federal Government to reform the police. Inuwa, in a statement endorsed by his image-maker, DSP Onome Onovughagbogaya, called on Deltans and residents in the state to join the police in their quest to keep the peace in the state. While suing for partnership with all stakeholders, the police boss enjoined them to abide by the law and obey the state government’s directive on the curfew. He promised to ensure amicable resolution of the social unrest and advised all to embrace peace.

"#EndSARS: Aisha Yesufu warns protesters against distraction, division",https://guardian.ng/news/endsars-aisha-yesufu-warns-protesters-against-distraction-division/,"Nigerian activist Aisha Yesufu has urged youths not to get distracted in their protest against police brutality in the country. “Please don’t get distracted over this issue of who is this – eyes on the goal – forget the distraction,” Yesufu said in a video on Wednesday. “There is nothing to go into fighting mood over this nothing – so focus on your message and the results that you want is the most important.” Nigerian youths in thousand are continuing their protest against brutality, extortion, harassment and extrajudicial killings by police personnel. Their focus was first on the controversial Special Anti Robbery Squad (SARS) of the police which the inspector general of police Mohammed Adamu granted when he dissolved the police unit. Adamu thereafter assured Nigerians that officers found culpable in different acts of misconduct will face police internal disciplinary measures. However, the protesters are demanding an end to the misuse of firearms by police personnel as well as a total reform of the Nigeria Police Force. Governments in different states have appealed to the protesters to halt their demonstrations and called for negotiation with the youths. While the protests have been adjudged successful, there have been reports of division among leading activists and agitators on whether the protest should end. But Yesufu said such arguments could become injurious to the passion of protesters who want to see a better Nigeria. “I think a lot of people who have not been part of this protest as they should are coming out to talk about this protest being monetised,” Yesufu said. “Please don’t allow this. It is not like the last one that was called for EndSARS when people never turned up and they never take part in it and they are looking for everything to discredit the protest so that they can say that is the reason they didn’t join “If anyone has collected money for protest, drag the person out and let other people do their thing. If yours (protest) is monetised, another person’s isn’t monetised.” The Nigerian government on Tuesday announced that SARS will be replaced by a new unit – Special Weapons And Tactics (SWAT). The creation of the unit, however, will not stop the agitation. “Yes, we have seen the headlines from the government but what is the execution plan? What is the basis for a committee?” Yesufu questioned. “Can the government bring an execution plan where you know this is A B C – so that when it is not done, you know (because you have) a timeframe?”

From Twitter to the streets ... How Nigerian youths won #EndSARS war,https://guardian.ng/news/from-twitter-to-the-streets-how-nigerian-youths-won-endsars-war/,"It was a victory for social media and its users yesterday as the Nigeria Police Force buckled under the pressure of days of sustained #EndSARS trend, campaign and protests. The Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) was a special police unit allegedly infamous for terrorising and extorting money from young Nigerians. This is the third in the series of a successful social media viral campaign that stayed its course until results were achieved; the first being the January 2012 #OccupyNigeria rally in the wake of the petrol subsidy removal protest and the second, the 2014 #BringBackOurGirls (#BBOG) which went viral across the world to call attention to the abduction of the Chibok schoolgirls. The third edition of this successful social media campaigns was late in coming after several previous efforts to make #EndSARS a reality met stiff resistance on the streets. Each time there was a new incidence or victim of police brutality, #EndSARS trends, but efforts to galvanise the social media rants and rage into concrete action were always muffled by the announcement of a promised reform in the police unit. A few days afterwards, the old order would continue.

Yesterday, October 11, 2020, was the culmination of a movement that could no longer be resisted; just like the famous Victor Hugo quote: “Nothing is as powerful as an idea whose time has come. There is one thing stronger than all the armies in the world, and that is an idea whose time has come.” Rinu Odule (3rd L), one of the coordinators of the demonstration, speaks during a demonstration to call for the scrapping of the controversial police unit at Ikeja, on October 9, 2020. – Nigeria’s top police chief banned a controversial anti-robbery unit and other special agents from mounting roadblocks and carrying out stop-and-search operations over accusations of abuses.

(Photo by PIUS UTOMI EKPEI / AFP) Until last week, the activism of Segun Awosanya, popularly known as Segalink, one of the strong voices in the #EndSARS campaign, had been like a lone voice in the wilderness until the widespread reactions that trailed the shooting of a young man in front of a hotel in Ughelli, Delta State, by Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) operatives on October 3. This time, the #EndSARS campaign left the streets of Twitter to the streets of Lagos, Ogun, Oyo, Delta, Abuja and across the country after social media influencers, celebrities, actors, politicians, among other concerned Nigerians, weighed in. The video, which went viral, showed how there was confusion around Wetland Hotel in Ughelli area of Delta State, where the policemen allegedly killed the victim and escaped with his vehicle – a white Lexus Sport Utility Vehicle. Though it was swiftly debunked by the Minister of State for Labour, Festus Keyamo, who stated that the victim was still alive and was not shot at but only jumped down from a moving police van, the video had reignited the #EndSARS campaign, and after months and years of angst and protests on the streets of Twitter against SARS, it finally spilled over into the streets of major cities across the country. Some of the celebrities and activists who made their voices heard last week included Ayo Balogun (Wizkid), Tiwa Savage, Folarin Falana (Falz), Runtown and Aisha Yesufu, who has been described as the hijab-wearing revolutionary. A writer, Fredrick Nwabufo, yesterday wrote: “Women, like Aisha Yesufu” are like comets; they come once in a generation bearing the torch of truth, courage and resilience. They are lodestars, shining a light on the path to a new world where humankind can thrive without chains and shackles. They are definers of the age; excellent species of their kind.” Other social media influencers who rose stoutly and stood tall in this campaign included comedian, Debo Adebayo, popularly known as Mr Macaroni, @SavvyRinu (Convener Operation Santize), @DannyWalta, @UnclePamilerin @TemiOanu, @Dehkunle among others.

He was rushed to Bowen University Teaching Hospital where he died while receiving treatment. Pictures shared on Twitter showed him standing by the roadside, many metres away from the policemen and unarmed moments before he was shot. The battle has been won, but the war is not over. This was how Wizkid ended the protest yesterday in front of the Nigerian Embassy in London when he said: “This is just the beginning. We won our fight to #EndSARS. Now reform the Nigeria police. #EndPoliceBrutality. We deserve good governance.”

Kaduna school abduction confirms failure of FG to secure Nigerians — BBOG,https://guardian.ng/news/kaduna-school-abduction-confirms-failure-of-fg-to-secure-nigerians-bbog/,"The recent abduction of six students and two employees of Engravers College in Kaduna, on October 3, 2019, has been described as a continued failure by the Federal Government to secure, preserve and dignify citizens’ lives. Incapacity, apathy and failed leadership made the list of tags labelled against the President and the Federal Government, yesterday, as Nigerians marked Day 2000 of abduction of 276 schoolgirls from Government Girls’ Secondary School (GGSS), Chibok, Borno State, on April 14, 2014. Meanwhile, students and staffers of Engravers College have joined the list of Nigerians still missing, including Leah Sharibu, Alice Ngaddah, Grace Taku, her colleagues and many others. ”Amidst these tragedies, the reality is one in which the Chibok girls are supposedly represented by a government that repeatedly fails in its primary responsibility of the protection of lives. ”Disturbingly, the government appears to be at ease amidst the troubles of the land, only concerned about protecting a fake-reputation that offers its citizens no value,” the #BringBackOurGirls Movement, said during its collective procession held in Abuja, Lagos, New York & Washington, DC. The group also called on local and state governments to accelerate actions necessary to bringing back the rest of the Chibok girls, including Leah Sharibu and others, especially the schoolchildren, to their distressed families. One of the conveners, Aisha Yesufu lamented the girls were forced to suffer unimaginable horrors by enemies of humanity and their families. ”This nightmare continues to be the shame of a nation and an open sore that threatens to become ingrained within the darkest parts of our collective history. How can we have continued this way?” Florence Ozor, a member of Abuja arm of the movement, said. So far, from the 276 girls abducted in April 2014, 57 escaped, four found, 103 released, four infants found with recovered girls, 19 parents dead and 112 Chibok girls still with the abductors."
Aisha Yesufu: The Voice Of Humanity,https://guardian.ng/life/aisha-yesufu-the-voice-of-humanity/," The third sentence in her Twitter bio is direct and unambiguous – You would either love me or hate me and either one is perfectly okay! Often maligned for her stance on national issues in Nigeria by pro-government voices, she is not a run-off-the-mill activist. Her penchant for naming names has earned her truckloads of enemies, and perhaps, admirers. Born in Northern Nigeria, a society where speaking up as a female was unheard of, 10-year-old Yesufu was already standing up against injustice. “Even though my parents or adults were angry at me for speaking up especially when it does not favour them; when they had that need to have someone that was unbiased to look at issues, they would call me.” “I have the gift to look at issues from both sides even when I am involved and when I am not. I am able to tell people, “okay look at it like this”. My mother would always say, ‘nobody wins in your court’, but in that same court when they want the issues to be told plainly, they would come.” Perhaps, her ability to speak up might be linked to her status as the firstborn in her family and the fact that she saw her father lose everything that he has. Aisha Yesufu That experience would change her life and thinking pattern forever. Rather than dwell on the losses and what could have been, the young Yesufu learned that life could change in an instant and because of that, she needed to make an impact urgently. “There was a time in my life in secondary school that I would go to school without breakfast and come back, not expecting lunch.” Another attribute she says helped her during this period was her insatiable hunger for books. Reading made her realise “there was a world beyond the ghetto that I was growing up in…and I wanted that life… and thank God in 2014, my mum would call and say, thank you for dreaming for everybody.” Yet, as it is customary in a patriarchal society such as Nigeria, the issue of being a girl sprung up occasionally. “You were seen as vulnerable because you were a girl. During our time, you were not even supposed to have a voice and even though it got me into a lot of trouble then, I was good with that [speaking up].” As Aisha grew, her knowledge and refusal to back down grew even if it meant an argument with her father. “Sometimes, I would argue with my father for literally 12 hours and my mother would use her eyes to tell me to stop.” Like Aisha, her father was a tough breed in school and would challenge authorities which would sometimes land him in trouble. “My mum would say, you are complaining and she is just like you,” she says chuckling. Yesufu’s stubborn trait sprung up again in 1991 when she wanted to enrol in the NDA (Nigerian Defence Academy) and was rejected because she was a woman. “The most painful part is that I was told that women don’t attend. I was angry and was ranting.” At the three universities (Uthman Dan Fodio, Ahmadu Bello and Bayero) she attended, she recalls that her friends would avoid moving with her at the administrative block for fear of getting rusticated. “I knew those times that they could drive me away from school but I always thought, ‘on the issue, I am going to follow it through’. ” Yesufu quickly learned that if she was going to continue speaking up, she had to ensure that her integrity was maintained. In 2000, during the compulsory National Youth Service Corps (NYSC), she would fight to a standstill to return the extra stipend that was paid into her account. “The NYSC officials were asking, ‘what type of thing is this?’ and frustrated me in every way.” “Today I ask myself if I had kept that money, what moral justification would I have to speak against injustice?” Like the stars aligning in her favour, that prepared her for what she has become known for- activism. While Yesufu’s family had adjusted to her stubborn traits, her mother was concerned about the marital future of her daughter and if she would be able to stay married. Coupled with the fact that she had no female friends when she was 11 because they were all married off or dead [during childbirth] and her getting married at 24, a time considered as late by some conservatives in Northern Nigeria. Yet, Yesufu says that her husband of 21 years is her number one fan. With his support, she can face the world, she adds with a hint of pride. His main priority, she says, is to ensure that she is happy doing what she loves to do. Beyond this, Yesufu admits that she is “lazy” when it comes to house chores, a trait, that did not sit well with her parents when she was growing up. “I am very, very lazy. My parents used to say, ‘Is everything book?’ Even when my husband proposed, I told him, I am lazy and I hate housework, I hate cooking and he was ready to go with it.” “I set systems in place to work for me. I hire and pay people to make me jobless. By the grace of God, I will never work for anybody so I have time on my hands.” That is not even the rather surprisingly part. She says that she was the one who approached her husband. “I first laid eyes on my husband on the 13th of December 1996 and I fell over heels in love with him and went after him.” 16 months later, they tied the knots. She tells me that at the early stages of their relationship, her husband spoke to her on the need to stay financially independent. “He was an auditor and was always travelling. One day he told me, ‘If anything ever happens to me, I will want you to always take care of yourself and kids if we have them’.” “Being brought up to expect that a man that will take of you, it was my husband that taught me to be financially independent so that I can have control over my voice and not be dependent.” Aisha Yesufu Interestingly, Yesufu says that if she did not take up activism, she would have been a singer and dancer. Doing what she loves to do includes living life to the fullest, travelling and acting goofy, she tells me laughing. She also prides herself as “very romantic.” “I have been married for 21 years and every day is a romantic fantasy that I am fulfilling.” Good thing her last child is going to the university so there is more time to have fun with her husband, she says. It is clear that her activism has made a huge impression on Nigerians. Bring Back Our Girls (BBOG), the longest-standing protest in Nigeria, attracted the attention of former first lady of the United States, Michell Obama; Hillary Clinton; had its hashtag #BringBackOurGirls tweeted more than 2 million times; inspired a spark of protests in US, UK, South Africa, Jamaica and Switzerland; represented in Marvel’s Black Panther; spoken on by Wyclef John, Chris Brown, and disseminated by the international and national press. Since the BBOG, Nigerians have exhibited boldness to speak up against the government, go on protests and have been vocal about their grievances. This does not mean that she is not oblivious of the fear expressed by people in society. “Of course, there is always that fear that if you speak out, you will be killed… but death is death and it would come when it would come.” “The worst thing anyone can do to me is to kill me. I’m going to die anyway, so it’s really not the worst thing because It is going to happen anyway. It’s another kind of death too if I am not able to express myself.” In respect to this, she says that every time she goes to protest; she says her last prayers. “I say maybe I am not going to leave this place, but whatever it is, that is what it will be.” As the number of Nigerians voicing out against government stays on the rise, Yesufu is happy with the change of status quo. “Growing up, the average Nigerian was taught that you should not question elders. They grew up with how not to question authority and it went on through school. Now that they have become adults, they have used government to replace parents so they don’t question authority.” “Fortunately, we are seeing more movements like BBOG inspire them to stay on course. They are realising that the office of the citizen is actually the highest office in the land. They are realizing that we don’t need permission from the police to protest but protection.” “Whatever I am doing today, I am fighting for that little girl that I was that yearned for help, that begged to be helped with a textbook so that I can read and pass my exams. If I ever give up that fight, I will be giving up on myself.” Giving credence to social media and Oby Ezekwesili, a one-time Guardian Life cover subject, she says that Ezekwesili contributed massively to Nigerians embracing this truth. In recognition of the International Day Commemorating the Victims of Acts of Violence Based on Religion or Belief, she says strongly that the case of Leah Sharibu is an atrocity against humanity. She opines that a girl-child in an education quest should not have her future truncated because of religion. “I always tell people that the case of the Chibok girls and Leah Sharibu is a world case because when you say to the girl-child that she should dare to dream and shatter glass ceilings and she looks at the fact that 279 of the sisters did that and were abducted, and 112 girls are still in captivity and she sees that the abduction was because they dared to dream and refused to renounce her (Sharibu) religion, then the world needs to consider what actions the girl-child will be looking at.” Then again, in a country where religion is seen as a primary factor in one’s life, she says matter-of-factly that a major problem with Nigerians is their unacceptance of religion as a personal journey. “As a people, we are very religious but we are godless. We are more interested in eye-service. The same person who goes to church or mosque every day will not find it wrong in committing fraud or engaging in corruption.” Faulting the pilgrimage and the forex trading that Nigerian governments engage in, she opines that undue relevance is given to things that should remain personal. “The Nigerian system is wired in such a way that religion is given so much relevance when it comes to state matters. Why? They are subsidising for pilgrimage but not education which is more important. Of course, the politicians have found a way to use religion to gain things out of sentiment.” “Don’t tell me what religion you are, show me. Let me see empathy in you. Most people are ready to fight for religion but are not ready to fight for humanity.. when we get to heaven, everyone will see who went where,” she adds. Aisha Yesufu In life’s stories such as this, it is commonplace to hear tales of struggles, yet Yesufu who describes herself as a survivor calmly tells me that throwing in the towel is not something she can identify with. Linking it back to her stubbornness, she says that every attempt to take up an issue translates to her knowing the end thereof even if it means losing an opportunity. “Is the opportunity worth it? Maybe it is because I have no attachment to anything, even life itself.” “What I am never ready to lose is my worth, dignity, integrity, and character. If I lose everything and have to sell pure water, I will carry it on my head with dignity, and character intact.” “Another thing is, I hold myself to high standards.” “No politician or anyone in any parastatal would tell you that Aisha Yesufu came to my office to seek for an appointment or a contract.” “I want a level playing ground for everybody where the woman who sells groundnuts or is frying akara or the motorcyclists that are working hard to send their children to school should be able to get jobs based on their capacity and ability and not on who they know.” If she is bothered about the impression of people about her since then, she says she is not one to consider that as important and is unapologetic about her stance. “When people say ‘don’t you know you are a woman?’, I tell them, I don’t know.” “If you check my twitter, you’d see I don’t really do labels. I don’t see myself as male or female, activist or anything, I am me.” "
"Coalition faults Ezekwesili, Yesufu over alleged secret burial of soldiers",https://guardian.ng/news/coalition-faults-ezekwesili-yesufu-over-alleged-secret-burial-of-soldiers/,"A Coalition Against Terrorism and Extremism (CATE) has flayed an allegation that soldiers killed by Boko Haram were secretly buried.Former Minister of Education, Dr. Oby Ezekwesili, and her co-convener of BringBackOurGirls (BBOG), Aisha Yesufu were alleged to have made the accusation. A statement by Ezekwesili, Yesufu and Florence Ozor, had claimed to see photographs of some fallen soldiers being given secret mass burial.This was days after the Nigerian military had denied the killing of its soldiers by Boko Haram. But CATE’s National Coordinator, Gabriel Onoja, said in a statement that the comment by the BBOG’s leaders was to portray the Nigerian state as weak.He said their action was also calculated to boost the moral of the terrorists.Onoja urged the relevant authorities to take decisive action against the BBOG’s leaders, adding that the country’s security cannot continue to be at the mercy of some forces. He said its claim: “was infantile and could only have been meant to benefit the terrorists. The BBOG’s group was indirectly insulting the country and its citizens.” He stressed that the claim was part of a wider campaign of disinformation and fake news to attain a pre-determined objective.   “The photographs in question were ordinarily consistent with the casualty figures released by the military in the aftermath of the encounter with the terrorists.“We however noted that some internet trolls, in tandem with BBOG, manipulated these images by playing with perspective and depth of field.” The coordinator added that the idea was to create the impression that the entire Nigerian troops had been killed and were being secretly buried in the northeast.He expressed concern that the BBOG group curiously capitalised on what should have plunged right thinking people into a sober mood, to demand the unthinkable.      The group had asked the Federal Government to give them the official casualty figures for the month of July. Onoja urged the Federal Government and the Nigerian Army to shun the request.He implored the government to invoke the extant anti-terror laws as they apply to terrorists’ supporters."
