Slide 2: i followed up on Princess david to find another picture of her and David, i matched the David in this picture to another picture from another account named David Ukpo.

,https://www.instagram.com/p/CfMspoWDpt9/,"The Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, on Friday, told President Muhammadu Buhari to stop showing ignorance and hatred against Igbos.

The indigenous group has made this comment, in reaction to Buhari’s latest opinion in Rwanda that Nnamdi Kanu jumped bail, and therefore his freedom would be difficult.

The spokesperson of the group, Emma Powerful, has implored the international community to monitor president Buhari’s utterances.

The Nigerian leader had informed the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, UK, Boris Johnson that Kanu needs to defend his rants against the Nigerian Government.

While condemning the comment of the President, Powerful revealed that the president’s opinion has shown interference in Kanu’s trial.

The president had also implored the international communities to declare IPOB as a terrorist organisation.

The statement by Powerful titled: “Buhari and Presidency stop displaying their ignorance and hatred against Ndigbo to the public,” partly reads: “Also, the presidency always releases statements accusing and blaming IPOB of all manner of crimes both real and imagined. The latest of the intimidating tactics of the Nigerian government was the shameless and stupid accusation from the impostor in Aso Rock to the effect that IPOB is engaged in the destruction of oil pipelines across Nigeria and this again few days to Mazi Nnamdi Kanu’s court date.

“Is it not the same Buhari that said the government will not interfere in a subject matter before the court the one now making prejudicial statements to intimidate the Judge. The international community and Foreign Government should closely monitor the utterances from Nigeria’s Presidency which are obviously aimed at gravely interfering with the judicial process. Can Buhari be a Judge in his own court? Time shall tell.

“If this matter is further adjourned, Southeast politicians and elites need to be more cautious of their security, and possibly, they employ private/personal security because they may fall victim to these........

IPOB was reacting to Buhari’s latest comment in Rwanda that Kanu jumped bail, hence his release would be difficult.

Emma Powerful, the spokesman of IPOB, urged the international community to monitor Buhari’s utterances.

Buhari had told the United Kingdom, UK, Prime Minister, Boris Johnson that Kanu must defend his rants against the Nigerian Government.

Condemning the president’s comment, Powerful said Buhari’s comment has shown interference in Kanu’s trial.

The president also urged the international communities to designate IPOB as a terrorist organisation.

A statement by Powerful titled: “Buhari and Presidency stop displaying their ignorance and hatred against Ndigbo to the public,” reads partly: “Also, the presidency always releases statements accusing and blaming IPOB of all manner of crimes both real and imagined. The latest of the intimidating tactics of the Nigerian government was the shameless and stupid accusation from the impostor in Aso Rock to the effect that IPOB is engaged in the destruction of oil pipelines across Nigeria and this again few days to Mazi Nnamdi Kanu’s court date.

“Is it not the same Buhari that said the government will not interfere in a subject matter before the court the one now making prejudicial statements to intimidate the Judge. The international community and Foreign Government should closely monitor the utterances from Nigeria’s Presidency which are obviously aimed at gravely interfering with the judicial process. Can Buhari be a Judge in his own court? Time shall tell.

“If this matter is further adjourned, Southeast politicians and elites need to be more cautious of their security. #ipob #news #nigeria #nation #buhari",34,0,False,2022-06-24 16:27:26+00:00

Otti received the certificate of return from the National Chairman of the Labour Party, Barrister Julius Abure, at the party’s National Secretariat in Abuja.

Mr Abure was flanked by the National Treasurer, Mrs. Oluchi Oparah and the National Vice Chairman, South-South, Prince Reuben Favour, during the presentation of the certificate of return to the Abia Governorship standard-bearer, Otti.

Recall that Otti in May 2022 announced his withdrawal from the governorship primaries of the All Progressives Congress, which later took place in Umuahia, the Abia State capital.

He accused the national leadership of the APC of negating true democratic principles in the conduct of its gubernatorial primary election in Abia state.
Otti explained that this well-thought-out decision was taken after due consultation with the army of his supporters, stakeholders, and above all, respected leaders of the APC within and outside Abia State.

The Independent National Electoral Commission has disassociated itself from the purported primary election which allegedly produced Ahmad Lawan as the APC senatorial candidate for Yobe North and recognised only the 28 May primary poll that produced Bashir Sheriff Machina as the duly elected APC candidate for the district.

The position of the Electoral Umpire was contained in a legally admissible Certified True Copy (CTC) of INEC report for the primary election dated yesterday, 23rd June 2022.

This has laid to rest the issue of any purported primaries said to have produced Lawan as senatorial candidate.

The law provides that only election (primary, secondary) duly monitored by INEC is recognised in the eyes of law.

Ohanaeze made the clarification yesterday in response to President Muhammadu Buhari’s call on international partners, including the United States and Britain to treat IPOB as a terrorist organisation and, as such “block from the international financial networks”.

 
The call according to the organisation was made by President Buhari during his recent interview Bloomberg.

The IPOB, according to the national publicity secretary of Ohanaeze, Chief Chiedozie Ogbonna, is a creation of injustice, and alienation of the South East geo-political zone in the affairs of the country by the current All Progressives Congress-led federal government administration of President Muhammadu Buhari.

The Apex Court held that Buhari, having assented to the Electoral Bill on February 25, 2022, has no power to turn around to challenge the legality of the Electoral Act.
In a judgment prepared and just delivered by Justice Emmanuel Akomaye Agim, the action of Buhari in instituting the case was declared as a gross abuse of court.
The Apex Court said that the President by the suit sought to approbate and reprobate at the same time and that such must not be allowed.

Besides, the court held that Buhari had no power under any law to dictate to the National Assembly on law making.
The unanimous verdict held that Buhari having participated in the making of the Electoral Act by his assent, lacked Constitutional Powers to come up to challenge same.

He said Kanu, who is currently on trial, was being given every opportunity under the law “to justify all the uncomplimentary things said against Nigeria while he was in Britain.”

This was as he reiterated his commitment to leave office for the next administration in May 2023.

According to a statement by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, the President said this at a bilateral meeting with the British Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, on the margins of the 26th Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Kigali, Rwanda.

Okowa stated this while addressing the people of Delta and party faithful who turned out enmasse to receive him at the Grand Reception organised by the State PDP on Thursday in Asaba after his emergence as the party’s Vice Presidential candidate.

The governor, who appreciated God and thanked Nigerians for his elevation and support, said he was grateful to the Party Presidential Flag-bearer, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar and the National Chairman, Iyorchia Ayu, for selecting and nominating him as the vice presidential candidate.

According to Okowa, the Atiku/Okowa joint ticket is for victory, hope and the only ticket that will rescue power from the APC led government come 2023.

He said that the nation needed to pray, be resilient and be hopeful, adding that the process of rebuilding the country and give hope to the youth, women and indeed to Nigerians has begun.
