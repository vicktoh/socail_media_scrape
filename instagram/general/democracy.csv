Es ist Wahnsinn, dass ein Mann, ein Journalist, der die Wahrheit gesagt hat und so viele unethische Taten der US Regierung aufgedeckt hat einfach weggesperrt wurde.Folterei und Isolation sind sein Alltag.
Er hat für Wahrheit, Freiheit, Frieden und Gerechtigkeit gekämpft und wird jetzt dafür seit fast drei Jahren bestraft.
Ich möchte an ihn erinnern, Zeichen setzen und aufmerksam machen.
Ihr könnt hier auf www.freeassange.eu Petitionen unterschreiben und euch für seine Freilassung einsetzen.

The people really do have the power and it’s time to take it back. 

Women around the world need to stand in solidarity. And the men, well the men if they have ever loved a woman; whether their mother, sister, girlfriend, wife or friend, then they need to stand with them too.

____________________

‘Physical objects are conceptually imported into the situation as convenient intermediaries -- not by definition in terms of experience,
but simply as irreducible posits comparable, epistemologically, to the gods of Homer. Let me interject that for my part I do, qua lay physicist, believe in physical objects and not in Homer's gods; and I consider it a scientific error to believe otherwise. But in point of epistemological footing the physical objects and the gods differ only in degree and not in kind. Both sorts of entities enter our conception only as cultural posits. The myth of physical objects is epistemologically superior to most in that it has proved more efficacious than other myths as a device for working a manageable structure into the flux of experience.’

- Excerpt from Quine’s Two Dogmas

This afternoon, I shed happy tears when I got back to CA. 

Yet the heavy, wet, fat, tears of grief that I shed for the moment in time today that changed women’s and children’s lives as we know them, is weighted on my soul - thick, rusty, stuck, trapped, enslaved to a government that cares more about their egos, profits, and guns than they care about sustainable and efficacious human life. My heart is broken. 

I will not stop crying. I will not stop fighting. I will not stop being angry. I will not stop being a woman who is disgusted at the abhorrent choices made by people who are only motivated by clout, money, and control. F*ck this “democracy.” 

It is time for us to rise and fight especially for those within the system who have been strategically and purposefully punished. Now is the time where community, more than ever, needs to show up.

Give to @abortionfunds & @plannedparenthood and stock up on the Plan B pill for folks that may need it in your community.

. 

Click on link in bio to read the complete conference note and register. 
. 

'What are the patterns and conditions of democratic backsliding? How does civil society resist the encroachment of this rapidly shrinking civic space? What is the role of print/electronic media and social media in the rise of populism? What is the role of the judiciary in upholding the rule of law? How has the ‘new normal’ of Covid 19 impacted the state of democracy worldwide? Above all, what can education institutes do to instil democratic values in young minds? What can educators do to inspire active citizenship?

In India, today, we have travelled far from the ideas of Democracy that the nation was built on at the time of independence.'

In keeping with the urgent need of our times, History for Peace explores The Idea of Democracy at the annual conference for teaching history in Calcutta this year.

4)      The reflections of a 12-year-old refugee from the Russian invasion of Ukraine will be published this fall. Yeva Skalietska’s book is called “You Don’t Know What War Is: The Diary of a Young Girl from Ukraine.”

“Everyone knows what the word ‘war’ means, but practically no one knows what this word really represents,” Skalietska said in a statement released Wednesday. “I want the world to know what we have experienced.”https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/diary-of-12-year-old-ukrainian-refugee-to-be-released/2022/06/22/22e0699e-f228-11ec-ac16-8fbf7194cd78_story.html

 

Let’s hope that there will be time when no one will know what the war really is.

[அல் குர்ஆன் 19:66-67]

66. ""நான் இறந்து விட்டால் இனி மேல் உயிருள்ளவனாக எழுப்பப்படுவேனா?"" என்று மனிதன் கேட்கிறான்.

67. ""முன்னர் எந்தப் பொருளாகவும் இல்லாதிருந்த நிலையில் அவனைப் படைத்தோம்"" என்பதை மனிதன் சிந்திக்க வேண்டாமா?

[அல் குர்ஆன் 30:16]

16. (நம்மை) மறுத்து நமது வசனங்களையும் மறுமைச் சந்திப்பையும் பொய்யெனக் கருதியோர் வேதனையின் முன்னே நிறுத்தப்படுவார்கள்.

 तत्कालीन राष्ट्रपति फ़ख़रुद्दीन अली अहमद ने तत्कालीन भारतीय प्रधानमंत्री इंदिरा गांधी के कहने पर भारतीय संविधान की धारा 352 के अधीन आपातकाल की घोषणा कर दी। स्वतंत्र भारत के इतिहास में यह सबसे विवादास्पद और अलोकतांत्रिक काल था। 

आपातकाल में चुनाव स्थगित हो गए तथा नागरिक अधिकारों को समाप्त करके मनमानी की गई। इंदिरा गांधी के राजनीतिक विरोधियों को कैद कर लिया गया और प्रेस पर प्रतिबंधित कर दिया गया। प्रधानमंत्री के बेटे संजय गांधी के नेतृत्व में बड़े पैमाने पर पुरुष नसबंदी अभियान चलाया गया।
जो भारतीय इतिहास का सबसे काला दिन था। भारतीय लोकतंत्र और नागरिकों के सबसे काले अध्याय आपातकाल के विरोध में उठी हर आवाज को सादर नमन 🙏

Born into an aristocratic family, he was brought up in an environment of unquestioning obedience to France’s restored Bourbon monarchy. It was only with the overthrow of Charles X that Tocqueville accepted that the ancien régime was dead. He spent the rest of his life trying to find a middle way between absolutism and revolution. A tour of the United States revealed how bourgeois democracy might function. In The Man Who Understood Democracy, Olivier Zunz asks whether it is right to present him as an uncritical champion of the American democratic experiment, as some – particularly in the United States – have tried to do.

Portrait of Tocqueville by Théodore Chassériau, 1850

It’s another “Power” game, where they will throw in the word “Empowerment” a few times…

Isn’t it ironic? 
The ones who have no idea what it means to see your bodies change, hormones take over, the emotional and physical toll it takes to carry another being within you, especially,
if it is a forced pregnancy through violence - 
get to decide about that choice - 
a few weak men, parading as paragons of virtue, backed by misplaced religious misconceptions. 

A dark day for women’s rights. 
I hope women unite across the US and make sure they take back their right to have a choice, to make a choice.

Safe abortions.
Planned Parenthood.
Choice to make a choice.
Basic Fundamental Right.

No, it's not about what happened in the USA. (Oh come on, not now.)

Don't believe in power.

Don't be discouraged by the politics because God is bigger than politics.

A national election is drawing near in Japan and I felt compelled to publish my political view. (As if I was a famous rock star. LOL)

So I wrote some funny stuff on our Japanese website. (Is anyone even watching our Japanese website?)

I DON'T recommend you to read it.
Because there is no way to translate this long and complex text correctly even with a help from modern AI powered automatic translation algorithm.
(See? Even my English doesn't make sense.)

However for our Japanese friends, it might be an interesting read. 

No, I'm not serious. Truth is, I can never be serious when I talk about politics. I don't think it's a big enough issue compared to... I mean, compared to Love, God, and Rock'n'roll.

Anyway, don't forget to vote.
Don't forget to vote, my friends! It's very important. I'm serious. I will vote and Marie will vote. I'm pretty sure Shinryu will, too.

For now, have a look at my coffee cup and very dirty old keyboard of my laptop.

,https://www.instagram.com/p/CfNtK3Su-dj/,"Why is progress so difficult to process?  Or so intimidating?… This happens on every imaginable level - this propensity to align nostalgia with the reality of the present, when the present is exactly that - progress. 

It is frustrating and futile to advance and improve, when the default is to refer to the past … and such an odd perception, too - knowing, that on some level, the past was no longer applicable, so changes were made in order to move forward, with the sole intention of advancing and improving.

So it begs to question why, when moving in an unknown direction, there is an expectation of perfection… and an ignorant disregard or lack of comprehension that a new experience is unknown territory, where perfection is a dream and not a reality. 

This is exactly why we should fear a world where innovation and creativity are oppressed, and old ideals are revered.  When changes begin, every thought and decision should be actively in the present and moving forward.  The only reason to ever look back is to remember why it was left in the past - and not only to never repeat it, but to use it as a reminder to move forward…

The message behind this art is universal. At the root of a solution is commonality. Punishing the other side won't get us anywhere. It results in limiting rights and endangering peoples lives. If you don't want to hear about politics don't read beyond this point.

With gun control, abortion, climate change, January 6th hearings, etc. For those who don't know, over the past few weeks a bipartisan committee have been holding hearings to show the evidence uncovered proving that trump tried to prove his conspiracy and when all options were exhausted he ruthlessly used his supporters as puppets against people and eventually to cause the capitol riot. I struggle suggest that you watch the hearings to get a full and clear picture of Jan 6th #trump #jan6hearings #politics #republican #democrats",3,2,False,2022-06-25 03:07:47+00:00

ಈ ದಿನ, 47 ವರ್ಷಗಳ ಹಿಂದೆ, 25 ಜೂನ್ 1975 ರಂದು, ಪಿಎಂ ಇಂದಿರಾ ಗಾಂಧಿ ಅವರು ಆಂತರಿಕ ತುರ್ತು ಪರಿಸ್ಥಿತಿಯನ್ನು ಘೋಷಿಸಿದ್ದರು, ಎಲ್ಲಾ ಮೂಲಭೂತ ಹಕ್ಕುಗಳನ್ನು ಅಮಾನತುಗೊಳಿಸಿ, ವಿರೋಧ ಪಕ್ಷದ ನಾಯಕರನ್ನು ಬಂಧಿಸಲು ಆದೇಶಿಸಿದ್ದರು ಮತ್ತು ಪತ್ರಿಕಾ ಸ್ವಾತಂತ್ರ್ಯವನ್ನು ಮೊಟಕುಗೊಳಿಸಿದ್ದರು. ಈ ದಿನವನ್ನು ಭಾರತೀಯ ಪ್ರಜಾಪ್ರಭುತ್ವದ ಕಪ್ಪು ದಿನ ಎಂದು ಇತಿಹಾಸವು ಯಾವಾಗಲೂ ನೆನಪಿಸಿಕೊಳ್ಳುತ್ತದೆ.

While there is justified anger and disappointment at those that fought against abortion rights, let's not forget the weak Democratic leadership that got us here.

President Obama's cabinet allowed Mitch McConnell's corrupt GOP to block his rightful SCOTUS nominee paving the way for Kavanaugh. 

Then they rolled over and allowed the GOP to push through Justice Barrett.

Michelle Obama wisely once said ""when they go low, we go high"". With the fabric of our democracy very much under attack we can not afford to play polite politics. Today we moved one step closer to being an Autocracy

,https://www.instagram.com/p/CfNV7XRpTJS/,"the twilight moment has passed. the darkness is here.

today’s ruling is about power and control, about imposing minority personal and religious beliefs upon others. it isn't about life, this isn't a movement of love. if it were, it would include poverty, homelessness, healthcare, living wages, and education. it would include the life of the woman and her bodily autonomy, it would include the incarcerated, the life of the refugee, the life of the animals tortured in factory farming, species dying off due to climate change. it would be about war and profiting from war. many who call themselves ""pro-life"" would do well to take a step back and deeply contemplate what being “pro-life” really means. 

it is also clear that this desire and obsession to control and impose doesn't stop here. Judge Thomas' concurrent statement clearly airs the intention of this and rulings to come. contraception, same-sex relationships and marriages, and perhaps more rights, are next.

it is important to recognize that today's decision brings trauma and harm. my heart breaks in this dark time. my heart is with you today, my sisters, and all affected by today's decision. my heart is with all of us filled with palpable concern, worry, and fear within LGBTQ+ and BIPOC communities. i stand in solidarity with you, with us, and will stand, speak, and engage this day and in all the days to come.

we must not despair. the success of their cruelty depends on our loss of hope. we must hold the sadness and anger with the tenderness and fierceness of our love. we must put this love into action. that’s where hope lives, in the good and beneficial, tireless, persistent, fiercely compassionate work of people who refuse to stop loving.

let’s get out the vote. 80 million eligible voters sit out on elections. this year's midterm elections are vital. also, let’s donate to organizations that assist in covering travel costs to those seeking safe abortion and reproductive care.

may open hearts and sane minds prevail in this time.

Why that matters:
*
“The nation’s founders created the judiciary as an independent, co-equal branch of government to ensure it is protected from outside political influences.  An independent judiciary is necessary to ensure the rule of law is respected. Judicial independence means that judges are not subject to pressure and influence and are free to make impartial decisions based solely on fact and law.” https://www.americanbar.org/groups/public_education/resources/independent-judiciary-resources/
*
“‘It certainly seems like the longstanding norms of the institution are under a severe amount of pressure,’ Shapiro said. ‘It seems as if the polarization we are experiencing in the country is similarly being experienced on the court.’” https://www.reuters.com/world/us/under-pressure-abortion-leak-exposes-us-supreme-courts-disunity-2022-05-03/
*
“Why do Supreme Court Justices have lifetime appointments? ‘That was put into the Constitution to preserve the total independence of the judiciary,’ said Meltsner, the George J. and Kathleen Waters Matthews Distinguished University Professor of Law. ‘Once a justice is confirmed and takes a seat on the court, they’re not beholden to anybody.’” https://news.northeastern.edu/2018/09/21/why-do-supreme-court-justices-have-lifetime-appointments/ #democracy #independentjudiciary",12,0,False,2022-06-25 00:10:42+00:00

Dozens of states are expected to announce varying degrees of abortion bans and restrictions in the coming days and weeks. The vicious attack on an elementary democratic right, foreshadowed months ago by a leaked draft ruling, is part of a reactionary culture war agenda, waged by a particularly degenerate section of the US ruling class. It seeks to whip up the most backward and reactionary layers in American society during a period of profound economic crisis, which has heavily polarized society and has made life unbearable for millions of people.

However I believe in order to maintain social harmony people need to understand that there is half a country that wants the opposite of what you do. If 100% of the country wanted what you would want then our democracy would reflect that: clearly we are not at that collective agreement just yet or may ever will be. Now in order to maintain social harmony I believe conservatism needs to be counterbalanced with progressive presuppositions as so it doesn't destabilize.

,https://www.instagram.com/p/CfNNG2fvj-o/,"Even seeing this coming, it’s a kick in the solar plexus. 

A radicalized Supreme Court overturned Roe v Wade today, banning abortion immediately for millions of Americans. 

That same court yesterday struck down a hundred-year-old law in New York regulating concealed carry licensing — an actual “pro-life” law that created public safety and saved lives.

Yet the freedoms extended to guns do not extend to people who have a uterus.

More than 25 million women of reproductive age are now barred by the government from health care.

An extreme interpretation of religion has now been codified in a country whose core principles are supposed to include separation of church and state.

The loss of the right to abortion care and the rationale behind it opens the door to losing any other rights not specifically laid out in the constitution — contraception, interracial marriage, same-sex marriage. More.

This is a direct result of a radical, misogynist president appointing 1/3 of the Supreme Court, with help from a radical right-wing Senate, led by Mitch McConnell who forced through extremist ideologues who in no way represent the vast majority of Americans. 

If you care about your rights, for God’s sake vote in the midterms for a Democratic US Senator who will protect your rights.

We see in the January 6 hearings how there are still some Republican Party officials with integrity. We also see how difficult, even life-threatening, it is for Republicans with integrity to stand up for the truth and for their own voters. The party won’t have it. 

It's toxic.

There is not a Republican running for a US Senate office in November who will stand up for any of us. 

Vote. 

While we still have a chance.

And in the meantime, organize. 

Show up.

But don’t sink to their level. 

Talk to your friends and family. No matter how awkward it is. We cannot let violent radical extremists promote their violence, take our freedoms, hijack public safety, spread lies and encourage hate. We can all be better than this.

Today we witnessed the striking down of a Supreme Court ruling (7-2) that had been in place for 49 years. Today we saw an erosion of the freedom of human autonomy. This, to us, feels like an invasion of the freedoms we are suppose to have in the greatest country to have ever existed. Whether you are pro-life, or pro-choice, a human should feel like they have complete and total rule over their own bodies. In our opinion this is a tragedy. The erosion of settled law is very alarming, in our opinion. Today is a day that democracy took a step back. If you want to protect the sanctity of personal choice, but you don't know how, we have some solutions for you. Get involved. Be an advocate. Help shoulder the load. This isn't something that everyone is personally affected or effected by, but that doesn't mean that it will never happen. We fear that this has triggered a landslide that will come after freedoms granted by other court rulings. This week we are celebrating Pride by going in on the Stonewall Uprising. If things continue to erode like they did today, we could absolutely see an execution of the rights these brave men and women fought for. We ask that you listen to the struggle these proud strong souls fought for, and remember that democracy doesn't work unless our voices are heard. Sorry for the long post.

  This will hurt families in need. In cases of violence it will destroy communities. It will disproportionately impact the economically disadvantaged to such an extent as to create a sub poverty class of functioning adults trapped in servitude. 
  The statistical data concerning the level of health of women in America will indicate a decline through the duration of current laws and crime will begin to accelerate within 5 or 6 years as parents work longer hours and childcare is already out of reach financially. 
  The complete destruction of the family unit complete. Latchkey kids. Like we were. But without a safe space. And that's why I'm fucking crying rn. There is no right in a land that would so monstrously assume the will of it's people with the awareness of its proven and anticipated impact. 

  And to ""legislate"" it's morality... 
  A twisted take ever only on the will and tradition of a tight fisted and ignorant white man in nineteen thirty fucking five. 
  In a country where nearly 80% of the population have utilized or support the right to choose.

In this country several people of monumental wealth and power

made their will law. 

  And did so in plain view fully aware that it was in direct contravention to the majority public preference.
 And then they left the room quietly. Their thoughts only their own. And now only hours later, murmurs about more. 

We are backsliding into...
 I don't know what.

Your personal beliefs about the morality of abortion do not matter: it's the fact that the government is acquiring the power to strip people of rights that they thought they could count on. The Tenth Amendment ensures that rights do not stop with only those named in the Constitution. If such an ""inalienable Right"" can be so easily alienated, what else may follow? This is how dictatorships start.

If you are truly concerned about ""babies"", you should not be cheering for the government to have escalating latitude to send police armed to the teeth against unarmed civilians. Police that kill babies. You should be concerned with stopping rape. With advocating a healthy attitude to sexuality that allows contraception. Make getting a vas normal. Help see it that child rearing isn't solely placed on the so-called ""nuclear family"", when historically and across time it has long ""taken a village"".

🥴 Being intoxicated or using only indecent, obscene or profane language will be excluded from the offence.

⚠️ Definition of grossly offensive conduct is too broad and could unintentionally impact on someone suffering a mental health episode, or a protester who lashes out at police.

The US was founded on the principle that each state operates individually & the federal government supports the states. The founders were escaping being ruled by a king & wanted the citizens of the US to be truly free, so they limited the power of the federal government. Roe allowed the federal government to usurp the will of the people & required all states to allow abortion, which is in direct contradiction to the constitution. Reversing Roe gets the federal government out of it & allows the citizens of each state to decide whether or not to allow abortion & if so what kind of restrictions they want to impose.

,https://www.instagram.com/p/CfNIuc7POjD/,"All day I’ve heard from my friends and loved ones (that’s you) about their myriad feelings of despair, fear, anger, betrayal, rage and a spectrum of other (VALID) emotions. 

I spent the early morning feeling paralyzed and numb.

I don’t know about you, but the only way I can combat feelings of hopelessness and worry is to mobilize and move to action. The number one request I’ve fielded is: 
what now? 

I don’t have a ton of answers but I know we can and should trust the courageous organizers and activists who have been relentlessly fighting for reproductive freedom, for all of us, for decades. 

Here’s what I’m thinking:

1. Follow reproductive justice organizers and advocates, most especially Black women, indigenous women, women of color and queer and trans women and non binary folks. They have been leading this movement since before Roe v. Wade and have been in the struggle for fair and equal access to abortion and reproductive healthcare in the years since. 

2. Pick a Senate race AND house race. If we hold the house and expand our majority in the Senate, we abolish the filibuster and protect abortion rights legislatively. If you had a fun, inspiring experience talking to voters in 2020, 2022 promises to be even better. DM me if you want to know where to start. 

3. Get in the streets- our electoral victories in both 2018 and 2020 were a result of mass mobilization of folks who were passionate about the issues that mattered most. The women’s March, March for our Lives and maybe most importantly, the collective action following the murder of George Floyd paved the way for legislative wins and change at every level of politics. There IS a protest in your city. Find out the date, time and location and bring your friends. Democracy is not something we have, it’s something we do. 

I’ll share more in my stories including the thing that has gotten the most engagement since I’ve been back on the gram - pictures of me and my friend Ben. 
I love you. We’ve got this.

Overturning Roe v. Wade is a stain on democracy. Women will continue to have abortions, but in an unsafe and uncontrolled environment which will have immense implications on womens health and safety, not to mention criminalizing a medical procedure. This also sets a dangerous precedent for human rights and bodily autonomy. Sad day for women everywhere 💔

It's a signal that they are prepared to overturn the rights of Americans and fully attack and erase all LGBTQIA+ rights in the country.  Anyone who cares about the right to contraceptives or cares about anyone in the LGBTQIA+ community should not vote for anyone who does not support codifying those rights into law.  Otherwise those people do not care for those people. It's a farce.  Unless the GOP begins to lose elections of people who attack my community they will continue to attack us.  It's the goal and in their platforms. If you vote for them you are against all the members of the LGBTQIA community. There is no fence.

This was a case of democracy really working, many of the republicans who voted for this bill have explained that they did so because of the sheer number of constituents who reached out to them asking them to “do something” after the Uvalde shooting. 

The gun provisions are important, but almost as important is the focus on mental health in this bill. Republicans have claimed for years that mass shootings show a American mental health problem (not a gun problem) and several of them seem to have put their money where their mouth is with this bill.

A Note From The Graceful Lady:
 ♦️♦️♦️♦️♦️♦️
To Quote John Lewis:
The Vote is Precious. It is almost sacred. It is the most Powerful Non-Violent tool we have in a Democracy.”
 ♦️♦️♦️♦️♦️♦️
Today the Supreme Court interfered with the Rights of Women to choose to have an abortion. (THE SUPREME COURT REVERSED ROE vs. WADE)
They said it’s not our Constitutional Right.
So today I say to you the Power to make Positive Changes in our lives is in your hands. 
When the opportunity to Vote comes up in your City or State get out and Vote for the people that care about you and your family.
We live in a Democratic Society and if you want to keep it as such, don’t sit by and let people take away our Rights. 
 “Get Out And Vote.” 
Pay attention people. The quality of your life’s depends on it. 
The Law on Guns and the Law on Abortion is just the beginning.
Pay attention to elections in your area and vote for the people that will protect your Rights‼️
A Vote for the Right Person is a Vote for a Better Future‼️

Una #cortesuprema a trazione ""trumpista"" che dopo la scomparsa di #RuthBaderGinsburg, ha scritto una brutta pagina della storia americana, una storia sicuramente piena di contraddizioni anche sul fronte dei diritti sociali e civili, ma che su tanti aspetti ha avuto molto da insegnare.

Da oggi ogni stato #USA farà da sé: sono già almeno 13 i governi federali, tra cui quello del #Texas, in cui il divieto di interruzione di gravidanza é scattato subito. Per amor di libertà, di progresso, di una sana dialettica politica e civile, smettiamola di dire che la politica, i partiti, i leader, sono tutti uguali: Conservatori e Progressisti, Repubblicani e Democratici, non sono uguali. Ovunque nel mondo. Non tutti assegnano lo stesso valore alla responsabilità e libertà individuale. 
C'é chi ha generalizzato negli anni passati sottovalutando il pericolo. Oggi la realtà presenta un conto salatissimo per tutte e tutti. Un salto indietro di 50 anni che colpirà drammaticamente sopratutto le donne più fragili, vulnerabili e povere .

As someone whose entire account is about living with chronic and mental illness, health, healthcare, and all things related to the above, how do I stay silent? I can’t. I won’t.

Don’t want an abortion? Don’t get one. But keep your hands off the right for other women to have one. It may be for personal reasons, it may be for medical reasons, it may be due to rape or incest. Whatever the reason, it’s none of your business. 

This was a settled case as of January 22, 1973, and the fact that it’s being overturned (after these Supreme Court justices said under oath that Roe v. Wade was settled law) is horrifying.

This will not lead to more life. This will lead to more death. Unsafe abortions, more women will now die as a result. If you’re truly pro-life, this would be unacceptable to you.

I stand with women. I stand with women’s right to choose. I will always be pro-choice. I will always stand my ground, despite the people who may unfollow me because of it. It’s my account, and my voice, and I won’t be silent. #ProtectWomen

In testing the 120km route one day, Larry was not discouraged by the rain, and even refused shelter at the ferry crossing as it would have messed up his Strava recording. 💙💛
.
When asked why he is STEPPING UP for Ukraine, Larry replied:

“Riding a bike is both a solitary and a social activity much like participating in a free democracy. To me, riding symbolizes freedom as well as an interdependence upon others.

I ride in solidarity with Ukraine because I believe in democracy. Democracy is more fragile than we in the west believe. True democracy is not the norm in our world. 

When we look aside as someone is bullied we enable the bully. Simple acts of support and resistance when joined by many others is a powerful force. Let’s choose to stand up for Ukraine in their fight to overcome the bully that is Putin and his totalitarian dictatorship. 

Humanity can be better!”

,https://www.instagram.com/p/CfM6ad0v7l4/,"How states will ban or restrict abortions
State laws banning or severely restricting abortion access fall into three broad categories: 1) ""trigger bans,"" which ban abortion under most circumstances and go into effect with the fall of Roe; 2) pre-Roe bans still on the books; and 3) more recent laws that limit abortion to an early gestational age or ban it nearly totally. Some states have laws in more than one of these categories.

Thirteen states have trigger bans, laws that take effect either immediately, by state official certification or after a 30-day waiting period, if Roe is overturned. Once they go into effect, these laws would supersede other laws the state may have on the books, said Elizabeth Nash, a state policy analyst with the Guttmacher Institute.

""The trigger ban applies throughout pregnancy"" said Nash. ""It does not have a gestational age [restriction].""

Five additional states that don't have trigger laws do have pre-Roe laws banning abortion which could now be applied, depending on state legislative action or judicial enforcement. (Arizona's pre-Roe ban has been on the books since before it became a state.)

Numerous states have passed laws that prohibit abortions after an early gestational age, though trigger bans in most of those states trump these. However, among states without trigger laws, four have six-week bans that could take effect, assuming legal challenges against them are dropped.

Sixteen states and the District of Columbia currently have laws that protect the right to abortion, mostly before the point of fetal viability, according to the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation.",81,2,False,2022-06-24 20:40:00+00:00

.
He then went on to cite the defining cases regarding:
.
#BirthControl - yep, he wants to limit (even further) your ability to make #ReproductiveDecisions and/or to protect your #SexualHealth
.
#Sodomy - this means Anal & Oral #sex. More specifically #Gay sex. #SodomyLaws have historically been used to criminalize behavior of #GayMen. Welp, Evil Clarence wants to do it again!
.
#GayMarriage - saw this coming! If you live in a liberal state your legal, binding, consensual #marriage is probably safe. Just don’t leave that state - because Rapist-Rape-Face Thomas is bound and determined to invalidate your union… but only if you have the same type of #genitalia
.
This is what happens when it’s no longer about the #law and instead about #politics
.
When we ignore separation of #ChurchAndState
.
When we ignore #facts or when we embrace extreme #ideology just to spite the “other side”
.
To some this is one law change, but it’s so much more. Not only is it a DEFINING law but the decision is a HUGE step (in a disturbingly long line of steps) that is bringing our #democracy closer and closer to the edge.

,https://www.instagram.com/p/CfM4eSrvEQk/,"I created multiple paintings like this the same week I made one of the most difficult decisions a person can make in their lifetime—a decision that would have changed the trajectory of my life, indefinitely. 

Our lives are a series of choices. We choose to challenge the beliefs people have of us. We choose to be honest when it’s easier to lie. We choose to eat steak instead of vegetables. We choose to wake up instead of going back to sleep. 

Now, imagine those bigger choices that have the potential to revolutionize your life: like deciding whether to enable a loved one, or cut them out of your life completely; deciding whether you divorce an abuser, or stay unhappily together; deciding whether you move for the job of a lifetime, or stay put out of obligation. 

The only difference between all of these choices and the right to control one’s own body (choosing whether to be fundamentally responsible for the life of another human on this planet) is that the stakes of the former don’t always follow you so far down the road. 

People are going to say this is a Women’s issue. It’s not. If you’ve ever helped a friend/loved one deal with an abortion, then you know it takes support. If you’re a parent who saw your child grow up to fulfill their dreams and live life on their own terms, this one’s for you. If you’ve ever taken your partner to get an abortion, perhaps you’re grateful you weren’t celebrating Father’s Day last week. 

Allowing someone the freedom to make a choice about what they do with their own body is not a luxury, it’s a basic human right. We see people exert that right every day. We can judge them all we want, but we have little recourse when we attempt to block them from those decisions. And we like it that way. 

DO NOT GET IT WRONG: this decision will negatively affect people that matter dearly to you, in one way or another, for years to come. 

And if you still think you don’t know someone who has gotten an abortion, rest assured they just haven’t told you yet.

I come from a religious family. I get that people have their own beliefs. But this is America. Our very first Constitutional Amendment contains Freedom of Religion. That means I don't have to believe what you believe, and that's a Constitutional right. 

So why then, can you creep into my body and force your religious extremism upon me? I use birth control. I've used the morning after pill. These are my rights. To say otherwise is to take away autonomy over my own body. Would this sort of control be exerted over a man's body? We can't even get guns out of their hands. 

Believe what you will, but I have no room in my body for your religion. 

The path forward is to VOTE. Vote for elected officials who will protect our Constitutional rights--and not force religion down our throats. Because make no mistake, this decision was rooted in religion, not law.

Your happiness or sadness at the US Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v Wade today will depend on your cultural and political stance. Both of these are evidence of how they influence the law and the decision-making process.

In 1973 the Supreme Court voted in Roe v Wade that the US constitution would protect a woman’s rights to terminate her pregnancy. Nearly 50 years on, that right has been revoked in many US states. It is a controversial and emotional issue that has divided a country.

A massive step forward or backward – the US midterm election will play an important part... 🇺🇸

Nah, fam that is not how I roll 😊

Before the fight to save the theater, I was and am a long time community organizer and activist, both in college and after. Protecting and expanding human rights is the most important thing to me in life. The Pantages was always about that. Art is always about that. Movies are always about that. I was never saving a building for no reason, but saving it for people. I work and speak up about so many issues because I care deeply about others. 

If human rights, compassion, and empathy don't matter to you, I don't think you fundamentally understand art to begin with. Art is about experiencing other cultures and ideas you've never thought of before. It's about expanding your consciousness to new realms. It's about growth, knowledge, wisdom, and understanding. It's about progress. It's about taking a bold step forward into the unknown without knowing where it takes you.

Today is a terrible day for America and for the decades of progress we've been making to expand human rights to where they should have always been. As a cis male, I will never be pregnant, at least without extensive medical, advanced techno surgery. But I will never stay silent on oppression and disgusting laws meant to control and dominate women, trans folks, and vulnerable people who need support, resources, care, and love. It is only when you stand and fight relentlessly for rights that don't directly impact you, that you have true empathy. 

Abortion is a human right for anyone who needs it. Body autonomy and controlling your life is a human right and it's beyond insane that even has to be stated. 

If you are a fellow man reading this, speak the hell up for human rights.  Support women, champion the causes of trans people, and take these attacks personally as they impact your humanity. Abortion is a human right and the people will protect it as such.",8,1,False,2022-06-24 19:55:01+00:00

We’re still at the tip of this iceberg. America is not ok.

Until we stop living and legislating based on fear, control, beliefs, and capitalism - and the myth that the “American dream” was meant for all Americans - human rights will continue to diminish.

To my fellow millennials who continue to take part in the great American experiment, who continue to educate themselves regularly on the most important issues concerning US and global politics…and then go out and VOTE based on what they believe to be right…THANK YOU. Republican, Democrat, or Independent, THANK YOU.

But specifically to my fellow Democrats…stop complaining and vote this November. You want protected abortion rights? You want marriage equality? You want better funding for schools and smarter policing? You want better environmental policies to tackle climate change? You want better socioeconomic and racial equality?

It’s easy to WANT something…it’s entirely different to then go out and GET IT.

VOTE. VOTE. VOTE.

,https://www.instagram.com/p/CfMzfCsghjd/,"Today in the US, the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and ended 50 years of federal abortion rights. They voted to take away the bodily autonomy of an entire population while insisting that they care about our lives. Tens of millions of people, mostly marginalized groups and the working class, will have to cross state lines to seek reproductive health care. They will be forced to bring a pregnancy to term, even at the steepest personal and familial costs. I am angry, gutted, and grieving. This is a dark day for American democracy. But I will not give up. They would like us to feel defeated, powerless, and alone. But we are the majority. Band together and do not surrender. Defend democracy. Defend your rights, the rights of our future generations, and the rights of others, especially if you aren’t among those directly affected.

The growth of the professional lobbying of MPs and the executive raises similar questions about money in politics. More broadly, inequalities emerge in terms of the opportunities the public have to participate in political debate. This analysis of the ways wealth can be used to influence politics in Britain explores the threat posed to the principle of political equality. As well as examining lobbying and party funding, the discussion also focuses on the ownership and control of the media, the chance to be heard on the internet and the impact of the privatisation of public spaces on rights to assemble and protest. Looking at this range of political activities, the author proposes various strategies designed to protect the integrity of British democracy and stop inequalities in wealth becoming inequalities in politics.

What does this mean? “Constitutional” refers to the fact that government in the United States is based on a Constitution which is the supreme law of the United States. The Constitution not only provides the framework for how the federal and state governments are structured, but also places significant limits on their powers. “Federal” means that there is both a national government and governments of the 50 states. A “republic” is a form of government in which the people hold power, but elect representatives to exercise that power.” It’s important to understand your country.

RIGHT NOW, eight @americanuniversity students are under investigation for talking about abortion.

The academic and legal careers of these law students hang in the balance after a conservative student filed a complaint that the students harassed him based on his religious beliefs during a private group chat over abortion rights.

They didn’t even mention his religion.
American is investigating the law students under the university’s overbroad non-Title IX harassment policy that bans all speech and conduct that subjectively “offends.” 

FIRE has repeatedly warned American that its policies are ripe for abuse. The school earns FIRE’s “yellow light” rating, denoting institutions that maintain a policy “that too easily encourages administrative abuse and arbitrary application.”

FIRE is exploring advocacy options to defend the law students from the time, stress, and expense of a bogus harassment investigation. 

Investigations into clearly protected speech create a chilling effect among students — which is a punishment in itself.

These investigations must end immediately.

'𝗢𝗥𝗗𝗜𝗡𝗔𝗥𝗬 𝗣𝗘𝗢𝗣𝗟𝗘 𝗪𝗜𝗟𝗟 𝗦𝗨𝗙𝗙𝗘𝗥 𝗧𝗘𝗥𝗥𝗜𝗕𝗟𝗬 𝗙𝗥𝗢𝗠 𝗕𝗥𝗘𝗫𝗜𝗧' - 𝟮𝟬𝟭𝟵

On BBC Question Time in April 2019, MP David Lammy, then a leading Labour Remain campaigner, eloquently spelt out how ordinary people will ""suffer terribly"" from Brexit.

He said then that the British people, “in their own interests”, should have the option to remain in the European Union.

But yesterday, the Shadow Foreign Secretary, said he and his party now accepts Brexit, and that “there cannot be a rehash of arguments” made in remainer constituencies like his in London.

A Labour government will not attempt to rejoin the EU or its Single Market, he said.

“The British people have made a decision and we have to honour it,” he told the UK in a Changing Europe's annual conference.

He added that he had the “scars” on his back from past attempts to get a second referendum.

“We’re not going over it again. And I’m afraid, psychologically, we’ve got to come to terms with that,” he said.

▪ 𝗠𝗬 𝗥𝗘𝗦𝗣𝗢𝗡𝗦𝗘: David, we all have scars on our backs from campaigning against Brexit.

But nothing fundamentally has changed. Brexit is still bad.

Accepting it won’t remove the scars or prevent new scars ahead as Brexit more deeply hurts people’s jobs and livelihoods, as you clearly and passionately pointed out just three years ago.

Rejoining the EU, or at least its Single Market, is a real democratic possibility. It has the support of many millions across the country – quite likely a majority of voters.

My question today: How is it that so many passionate Remainers like you have given up? Brexiters campaigned for over 40 years to get us out of the EU.

A Labour Brexit will inflict damage on Britain and Britons just as the Tory Brexit is already doing.

David, you said of the Tories in April 2019:

“It is a travesty that we have got to a place where a mainstream political party could want to wreak this kind of havoc on our country.”

Et tu, Labour?

He also seems to be an individual who has acted against his own party's interest on the ‘INSTIGATION’ of the BJP, who are burning 🔥 with the flames of ‘DESPERATION’, to get back power in the West India 🇮🇳 state, they had lost  in 2019 to the Shiv-Sena, NCP, and Congress combination. #maharashtrapolitics

As a result  of which, Shinde who is also a cabinet minister in the state government has also ‘CONVINCED’ apparently more than 40 ‘MLA’S (Members of Legislative Assembly) of the Shiv-Sena, to join him in his ‘OBSSESION’ to successful stir up ‘REBELLION’ to satisfy his own greed for more power and not looking at the need of Maharashtrians. 

This political ‘CIRCUS’ a clear ‘INDICATION’ of how Indian ‘DEMOCRACY’ filled with ‘HYPOCRISY’ has become all about grabbing power by ‘HOOK’ or by ‘CROOK’ with no concern whatsoever towards the public, a trend that is very tragic. 

Above all, the sudden rise of Shinde who was once a ‘RICKSHAWWALLAH’ like our ‘DEAR PM’ who was a ‘CHAIWALLAH’, has unfortunately proven to us that in Indian politics today, sadly it is the individual with the least ‘QUALIFICATION’ and ‘INTELLIGENCE’ who ends up becoming a ‘LEADER’.

Lecture Tuesday 10:30 - 1:20 PM
@ Burnaby Campus

THE GREEK WORLD

Take a trip to #Greece with us. Visit the #Aegean sea and see how far-reaching Greek #history and #philosophy has been — from Bzyantium's palaces, to merchants in Florence. 

This course is a study of the #Greek World at large from the time when #civilization first stirred in the Aegean Sea through the #modern age. Starting with the dawn of civilization in the Near East we move to Homer’s heroic times, and then examine the rise of city-states, study the vibrancy of the Athenian #Democracy and the stark might of Sparta. Alexander the Great takes us to the rich Hellenistic world of the east. We then explore the lives of the Greeks and the afterlife of their ideas in the #Roman era when the teachings of Jesus are recorded in Greek into the New Testament and preached by St Paul by the Acropolis. 

Our journey ends in the present, reflecting on the economic crisis, cutting edge cinema and refugee movements.

One must face the fact that this Christian nation may never have read any of the Gospels, but they do understand money.”

And then there are the Christians who say “now our work begins…let’s care for moms and babies.” 

Trust me: they will not. How can you care when you are voting for a country that has more guns, less freedom, that is more sick and less just? 

That’s terrifying: if you can’t care for people until you win, then your theology never saw their humanity in the first place. They were only pawns in your game. That’s not of God or Jesus.

Think about it: someone can only “now” begin to care about your rights, healthcare, wellbeing, and freedom when the government takes all that away. 

That is not love and community. That is hate and indifference.

,https://www.instagram.com/p/CfMmah2JHcI/,"Ending a near 50 year precedent, SCOTUS has officially struck down the constitutional right to an abortion in the United States and has given that decision making back to the states. The decision came along partisan lines with all conservative justices voting in favor of overturning Roe v. Wade and the liberal justices dissenting for a 6-3 decision. After this ruling, about half of states are expected to take action against abortion access and some states are on “trigger ban” to completely eliminate abortion access due to this very consequential ruling. President Biden (D) has already spoke on the matter and has vowed to protect access to contraception and the rights of women. Part of the country celebrates the decision of Roe being overturned, while the other takes this as a step backwards in American history.

The ruling overturning Roe v Wade is the culmination of decades of work by conservatives – assisted by a president named Donald Trump, Jessica Glenza reports:

The short version of how Americans lost their right to terminate a pregnancy might be summed up in one name: Trump.

The real estate tycoon and reality-TV star first shocked the world by winning the US presidency, then rewarded his base by confirming three supreme court justices to a nine-member bench, thus rebalancing the court to lean conservative for a generation to come.

That short road led to Dobbs v Jackson Women’s Health Organization, an opinion released this week in which supreme court justices voted 6-3 to overturn the landmark case Roe v Wade, which in 1973 granted a constitutional right to abortion.",10,7,False,2022-06-24 17:23:29+00:00
,https://www.instagram.com/p/CfMaptjrRSB/,"Roe Vs. Wade has been overturned ending 50 YEARS of abortion rights.

Theres no words to accurately describe the grief that is washing over the US right now. 

This represents the stripping of Womens rights. What’s next? Women can’t vote anymore? Because it goes hand & hand to me. 

This is the beginning of a very slippery slope. My heart goes out to the LGBTQIA  community and minorities. 

We are moving backwards, not forward. Women in other countries try unsafe abortion techniques and even take their own lives because of unwanted pregnancies— we can expect the same to unfold here. 

“It's a slap in face to women about using their own judgment to make their own decisions about their reproductive freedom"" 

I hope everyone in support of this plans on adopting, being foster parents, and donates their time and energy to shelters… but we all know they won’t. They’ve lived a very privileged life—which is why the devastation doesn’t even register on their radar.
