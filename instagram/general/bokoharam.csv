At the talks, on Boko Haram insurgency, Buhari said there was serious effort to educate the people on the fact that only an unserious person could kill innocent people, “and say Allah Akbar (God is Great). God is justice.
.
”You can’t take innocent souls, and ascribe it to God. And the education process is working, the people now understand Boko Haram as anti-God, and not about religion.”

Hauwa made this disclosure while narrating her experience to newsmen in Maiduguri, the capital of Borno State, at a news conference which took place at the Command and Control Centre, Maimalari Cantonment.

She narrated that as terrorists were running for their own lives; and troops were gaining more ground in the camp, she used the opportunity to escape from the terrorists’ camp.

She said that “On my way, I met with some of the insurgents who asked me where I was going, but I tricked them by telling them that I was following some women to hide in the nearby forest.

“I slept under a tree with my child, then proceeded the next day until I arrived at the road where I approached a military checkpoint.

“Initially, they thought I was a suicide bomber, but when I explained my self, they took me along with them.”

Hauwa Joseph said she was married by force to one of the Boko Haram’s Commanders at Gazuwa camp, Amir Abbah, who was later eliminated during a face off with the troops of the Nigerian Army.

She appreciated the military for saving her, saying that she hoped other girls who are still in the captivity of the terrorists’ would be rescued.

Gazuwa camp is the headquarters of Boko Haram faction, formerly known as Gabchari, Mantari and Mallum Masari, located about 9 kilometres to Bama Local Government Area of Borno.

The girls, who were married to Boko Haram commanders spoke at an interactive session with journalists on Tuesday in Maiduguri, at a news conference at the Command and Control Centre Maimalari Cantonment.

Maj. Gen. Christopher Musa, The Theartre Commander, Operation Hadin Kai North East Joint Operation, told journalists that both girls were among the list of the missing Chibok girls.

Less than 100 of the abducted girls have been rescued since the abduction which attracted global outrage in 2014

Musa said that the girls were rescued due to a massive military operation in Sambisa Forest, Mandara Mountain, and the Lake Chad area.

Marry Dauda, who recounted her experience in the hands of the insurgents, said she could still vividly recall her compulsory marriage eight years ago after she was abducted at the age of 18 years.

Dauda said that she walked through the deadly forest for many days before she found help.

Like the others conscripted by the militants, she had been told that she would be hunted down and killed if she deserted.

She said “I took excuse from Malam Ahmed, that I will be visiting my relative from Chibok in the town of Ngoshe and he gave me one week. That is when I began my journey for freedom.

“I left Sabil Huda, popularly known as the camp of Abubakar Shekau and proceeded towards Njimiya and Parisu, where I met some of the Mujahedeens. They asked where I was going to and I told them I was given permission to visit my sister in Ngoshe.

“I finally arrived Gava village in Gwoza, after walking for many hours through the deadly forest under hardship condition. I asked some people to direct me to the home of daughter of Chibok.

Accordingly, the chamber urged the military to carry out a comprehensive onslaught on the bandits and criminal elements within Kainji Lake National Park and the identified communities. 

The names of communities given by the chamber include Kaiama, Karonzi-Yashikira in Baruten Local Government, and Wawa and Babanna areas in Niger State. 

These formed part of resolutions reached by the Senate after it considered a motion on the “worsening insecurity in Kainji Lake National Park and existential threat to communities in Kaima, Baruten and Borgu Local Government in Kwara and Miger States.” 

The motion was sponsored by Senator Sadiq Sulieman Umar (Kwara North), and co-sponsored by the Deputy Whip, Senator Aliyu Sabi Abdullahi (Niger North).

,https://www.instagram.com/p/CfGbnW2tkD7/,"President Muhammadu Buhari has appealed to international partners to declare the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) a terrorist organisation.

The president, while fielding questions on the country’s security problems, stated that his administration acquired fighter jets from the United States and engaged in intelligence sharing with the United Kingdom to prosecute the war against insurgency in the country.

The president said this in an interview with Bloomberg, on Tuesday, 21 June.

Buhari said terrorists no longer hold any territory in Nigeria unlike what obtained in 2015 when ""Boko Haram held territory the size of Belgium within the borders of Nigeria"".

“Today they are close to extinct as a military force. The leader of ISWAP was eliminated by a Nigerian Airforce airstrike in March.

The jets acquired from the US and intelligence shared by British were not provided to previous administrations and stand as testament to renewed trust re-built between Nigeria and our traditional western allies under my government.

""We urge those same international partners to take additional steps costing them nothing, by proscribing another group – IPOB – as a terrorist organization.

“Their leadership enjoys safe haven in the West, broadcasting hate speech into Nigeria from London, spending millions lobbying members of the US Congress, and freely using international financial networks to arm agitators on the ground. This must stop,” he said.

Buhari stated that his administration was the only one in Nigeria’s history to implement a solution to decades-long herder-farmer conflicts, exacerbated by desertification and demographic growth.

""The National Livestock Transformation Plan, putting ranching at its core, is the only way to deplete the competition for resources at the core of the clashes. Governors from some individual states have sought to play politics where ranches have been established; but where they have been disputes have dramatically reduced,” he said.

El liderazgo carismático se define como aquel que tiene el poder y la capacidad de inspirar a sus seguidores, mientras que estas habilidades se derivan únicamente de la fuerza de carácter y el compromiso del individuo.

Members of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) were accused of carrying out the terrible murder while imposing a sit-at-home order in the area.

At least two vehicles were set on fire by the terror group, according to reports. According to a local who spoke with us, the incident caused traders and customers in the market to flee for their lives.

The gunmen had previously visited the market, according to the source, to warn the traders about the consequences of going out on a Monday for their commercial transactions.

According to the story, many people were harmed while attempting to flee the danger.

""They rushed in and tossed a small bomb inside the market, and everyone ran for cover; they poured petrol on two vehicles, and everything caught fire,"" the person said.

Check out “A Long Way from Douala: A Novel” by Max Lobe 
______________________________
This heartwarming coming-of-age tale follows two friends on a journey across Cameroon as they grapple with grief, sexuality, and dreams of leaving. 

After their father’s sudden death, Jean’s older brother Roger decides he’s had enough of their abusive mother and their city. He runs away to try his luck crossing illegally into Europe.

Aiming to catch up with Roger before he gets to the Nigerian border, Jean enlists the help of the older Simon, a close neighborhood friend, and the two set out on the road. 

Max Lobe insightfully touches on grave, complex issues, such as the violence #BokoHaram has inflicted on the region, yet still recounts events with remarkable humor and levity.

,https://www.instagram.com/p/Ce_77lbL2dK/,"Nigeria ist seit den 90ern ein Zentrum für Konflikte. Eine Ursache dafür ist die Tatsache, dass es sich bei Nigeria um einen Vielvölkerstaat handelt, in dem mehr als 250 ethische Gruppen mit unterschiedlichen religiösen Prägungen leben. In Zentralnigeria wird zwischen Bauern unterschiedlicher Religiöser Prägungen ein Kampf um Ressourcen geführt und immer wieder verüben islamistische Gruppierungen wie „Boko Haram“ oder „Islamischer Staat Provinz Westafrika“ Terroranschläge. Dazu kommt, die Destabilisierung, die durch die Kolonialzeit entstanden ist, und bis heute ein Problem darstellt – es handelt sich um ein Land großer sozialer Ungleichheiten und mangelnder Zukunftsperspektiven. Eine große Problemquelle ist auch die dortige Erdölförderung, die zu ungelösten Streitigkeiten zwischen der Bevölkerung, der Regierung und internationalen Erdölkonzernen führt. Sie schädigt dort auch die Umwelt, die Landwirtschaft und auch die Fischerei, was sich stark auf die dort lebenden Menschen auswirkt. Aufgrund der Unzufriedenheit mit der Ölindustrie gingen 1993 Menschen organisiert auf die Straße, um für die Rechte von Menschen einzutreten, die in den Erdölfördergebieten leben – als Reaktion darauf wurden die Gebiete vom Militär besetzt. Im August 2006 kam immer wieder zu Entführungen von Menschen, die mit der Ölindustrie in Verbindung standen und auch später noch fanden Entführungen und Bombenanschläge auf Ölfördereinrichtungen statt.
